Methods: Using homeostasis model assessment (HOMA), we estimated β-cell function (BCF) and insulin resistance (IR) from fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and insulin in 67 normoglycemic controls and 62 age- and BMI-matched normoglycemic pancreatic cancer patients. In addition, we studied 73 pancreatic cancer subjects with glucose intolerance; 21 had impaired FPG and 51 had diabetes. Results: BCF was similar in controls and normoglycemic pancreatic cancer subjects (64 ± 5 vs. 78 ± 9, p = ns), while IR was higher in pancreatic cancer subjects with normal FPG (1.6 ± 0.6 vs. 1.1 ± 0.1, p = 0.002). Among pancreatic cancer subjects, those with impaired FPG had markedly decreased BCF compared to those with normal FPG (44 ± 5 vs. 78 ± 9, p < 0.02) without significant difference in IR (1.9 ± 0.2 vs. 1.6 ± 0.6, p = ns). In cancer subjects, those with diabetes had markedly increased IR compared to those with impaired FPG (3.2 ± 0.3 vs. 1.9 ± 0.2, p < 0.0001), while the BCF was similar (37 ± 4 vs. 44 ± 5). Conclusion: Diabetes associated with pancreatic cancer is likely due to a combination of marked decline in BCF and increased insulin resistance. Copyright © 2005 S.

Methods: We searched EMBASE, MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and ClinicalTrials.gov for eligible studies published up to March 06 2016. This meta-analysis includes all studies reporting adverse events of pancreatic cancer with use of incretin-based therapies compared with placebo or non-incretin anti-diabetic drugs in patients with T2DM. We used fixed-effect model to compare pooled relative risk (RR) with related 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results: A total of 159 randomized trials were identified. Out of these, 135 studies were excluded as pancreatic cancer occurrence had not been included as an end point. The remaining 24 trials enrolling 47,904 participants were further assessed. Overall, no increased risk of pancreatic cancer were detected in association with incretin-based treatment (RR = 0.7, 95% CI 0.37–1.05). The incidence of pancreatic neoplasm was even lower among incretin-based groups than controls (RR = 0.50, 95% CI 0.29–0.87) in trials with duration more than 104 weeks. There was even decreased risk of pancreatic cancer within groups paralleled by incretin-matched placebos (RR = 0.55, 95% CI 0.32–0.93) than by non-incretin anti-diabetic drugs. Neither monotherapy (RR = 0.62, 95% CI 0.38–1.01) nor combination regimen (RR = 0.92, 95% CI 0.45–1.90) of incretin mimetics increased the risk of pancreatic cancer. Conclusion: This meta-analysis shows that incretin-based therapies are not associated with increase in the risk of pancreatic cancer. Interestingly, subgroup analyses suggested lower risk of pancreatic cancer in incretin groups than placebo in long-term studies (>104 weeks). Considering the inconsistent results among randomized trials and previous epidemiological investigations, more such studies should be conducted to clarify the existence or non-existence of this association.

Diabetes is a known risk factor for PC, and new-onset diabetes (NOD) could be an early manifestation of PC that may be facilitate the early diagnosis of PC. Metformin offers a clear benefit of inhibiting PC, whereas insulin therapy may increase the risk of PC development. No evidence has shown that novel hypoglycemic drugs help or prevent PC. In this review, the effects of T2DM on PC development are summarized, and novel strategies for the prevention and treatment of T2DM and PC are discussed. © Copyright © 2021 Duan, Wang, Pan and Guo.","hyperglycemia;

As the operative morbidity and mortality of pancreatectomy has improved, incidence has increased and survival has remained mostly unchanged. The diagnosis of DM2 suggests pancreatic dysfunction and possible early carcinogenesis. DM2 is a significant comorbidity predicting worse outcomes in patients undergoing pancreatic resection as part of the treatment of PC.

However, clinical studies have conflicting results and metformin's effect remains controversial. The aim of this study was to evaluate metformin's effect on clinical outcomes in diabetic patients with pancreatic cancer treated with curative resection. Results: A total of 764 patients underwent curative resection, met none of the exclusion criteria, and were prescribed oral hypoglycemic agents. The cancer-specific survival (5-year, 31.9% vs. 22.2%, p < 0.001) was significantly higher in the 530 metformin users than in the 234 diabetic metformin non-users. After multivariable adjustments, metformin users had significantly lower cancer-specific mortality as compared with metformin non-users (hazard ratio, 0.727; 95% confidence interval, 0.611-0.868). Cubic spline regression analysis demonstrated significantly decreased cancer-specific mortality with increasing dose of metformin (p = 0.0047). Materials and Methods: Data were provided from the Korea Central Cancer Registry and the National Health Insurance Service in the Republic of Korea. The study cohort consisted of 28,862 patients newly diagnosed with pancreatic cancer between 2005 and 2011. Metformin exposure was determined from prescription information from 6 months before the first diagnosis of pancreatic cancer to last follow-up. The main outcome was cancer-specific survival. Conclusions: This large study indicates that metformin might decrease cancer-specific mortality rates in localized resectable pancreatic cancer patients with pre-existing diabetes, independently of other factors, with a dose-response relationship.","Diabetes;

Methods: Using data on individuals of European ancestry from the Cancer Genetic Markers of Susceptibility PanScan-I study (1,763 pancreatic cancer cases and 1,802 controls), we tested associations for 37 T2D susceptibility variants with pancreatic cancer risk. Associations with pancreatic cancer were also tested for three composite T2D susceptibility measures, incorporating data on all 37 variants, and for ten additional variants related to T2D-related phenotypes, including fasting glucose and beta-cell function. Results: Of the 37 T2D risk alleles, two showed nominally significant positive associations with pancreatic cancer risk (FTO rs8050136 per-allele OR = 1.12; CI: 1.02-1.23; MTNR1B rs1387153 OR = 1.11; CI: 1.00-1.23) and one showed an inverse association (BCL11A rs243021 OR = 0.88; CI: 0.80-0.97). The composite T2D susceptibility measures were not associated with pancreatic cancer. The glucose-raising allele of MADD rs11039149 was associated with increased risk of pancreatic cancer (OR = 1.14; CI: 1.03-1.27). Conclusions: Overall, these results do not provide strong evidence that common variants underling T2D or related phenotypes also affect pancreatic cancer risk; however, associations for FTO, MTNR1B, BCL11A, and MADD variants warrant further investigation in larger studies. Hypothesis-driven analyses of existing genome-wide genetic data can be cost-efficient and promising approaches for investigating genetic susceptibility to complex diseases. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Genome-wide association study; Pancreatic cancer; Risk score; Type 2 diabetes","Adenocarcinoma; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Case-Control Studies; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; European Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pancreatic Neoplasms; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Risk Factors; glucose; adult; aged; allele; article; BCL11A gene; cancer risk; cell function; controlled study; disease association; Europe; female; FTO gene; gene; genetic susceptibility; genetic variability; glucose blood level; human; MADD gene; major clinical study; male; MTNR1B gene; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; pancreas cancer; pancreas islet beta cell; phenotype; priority journal","","glucose, 50-99-7, 84778-64-3","","","National Institutes of Health, NIH, (CA102484, HA); U.S. Department of Defense, (W81XWH-10-1-0499); National Cancer Institute, NCI, (U01CA122171)","Acknowledgments This work was supported by Department of Defense grant W81XWH-10-1-0499 (to BLP) and NIH grants CA122171 and CA102484 (to HA).

We aimed to identify the diabetogenic secretory product(s) of pancreatic cancer. Methods: Using microarray analysis, we identified adrenomedullin as a potential mediator of diabetes in patients with pancreatic cancer. Adrenomedullin was up-regulated in pancreatic cancer cell lines, in which supernatants reduced insulin signaling in beta cell lines. We performed quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry on human pancreatic cancer and healthy pancreatic tissues (controls) to determine expression of adrenomedullin messenger RNA and protein, respectively. We studied the effects of adrenomedullin on insulin secretion by beta cell lines and whole islets from mice and on glucose tolerance in pancreatic xenografts in mice. We measured plasma levels of adrenomedullin in patients with pancreatic cancer, patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, and individuals with normal fasting glucose levels (controls). Results: Levels of adrenomedullin messenger RNA and protein were increased in human pancreatic cancer samples compared with controls. Adrenomedullin and conditioned media from pancreatic cell lines inhibited glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from beta cell lines and islets isolated from mice; the effects of conditioned media from pancreatic cancer cells were reduced by small hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown of adrenomedullin. Conversely, overexpression of adrenomedullin in mice with pancreatic cancer led to glucose intolerance. Mean plasma levels of adrenomedullin (femtomoles per liter) were higher in patients with pancreatic cancer compared with patients with diabetes or controls. Levels of adrenomedullin were higher in patients with pancreatic cancer who developed diabetes compared those who did not. Conclusions: Adrenomedullin is up-regulated in patients with pancreatic cancer and causes insulin resistance in β cells and mice. © 2012 AGA Institute.","Mechanisms; Mouse Model; Pancreas; Tumor","adrenomedullin; glucose; insulin; messenger RNA; adult; aged; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; article; cancer cell culture; controlled study; diabetes mellitus; female; glucose blood level; glucose intolerance; glucose tolerance; human; human cell; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; insulin release; insulin resistance; male; microarray analysis; mouse; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonhuman; pancreas cancer; pancreas islet; priority journal; protein expression; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; supernatant; upregulation; xenograft","","adrenomedullin, 148498-78-6; glucose, 50-99-7, 84778-64-3; insulin, 9004-10-8","","","Lockton Endowment; National Institutes of Health, NIH, (R01 CA150190); National Cancer Institute, NCI, (R01CA100685); Mayo Clinic, (P50 CA 102701); Lustgarten Foundation","Funding Dr Chari was supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health ( R01 CA 100685 ) and the Mayo Clinic Pancreas Cancer SPORE ( P50 CA 102701 ); Dr Fernandez-Zapico, Dr George Klee, and Dr Petersen were supported by the Mayo Clinic Pancreas Cancer SPORE ( P50 CA 102701 ); and Dr Logsdon was supported by funds from the Lockton Endowment and the Lustgarten Foundation.

Materials and Methods: Pancreatic tissues from 11 donors (five without pancreatic disease and six with type 2 diabetes) and 11 surgical specimens from PC patients obtained from the cancer area (zone A) and the adjacent tumor-free area (zone B) were examined immunohisto- chemically. The size of islets, the number on ß-, α-, δ-pp-and IAPP-expressing cells and their ratios in the islets of these tissues were determined. Results: In the normal pancreas, only 50% of the ß-cells while α-and δ-cells co-expressed IAPP only sporadically. In tissues from diabetics as well as in zone A, the number of the ß-cells and the IAPP-expressing cells was reduced significantly, while the number of α-and δ-cells was increased. In zone B, however, significantly more ß-cell and IAPP-expressing cells and a significantly lower number of α-cells were found compared to those in zone A. Significant differences were also found between the specimens from type 2 diabetics and pancreatic cancer relative to the ratios of IAPP/ß-cell, IAPP/α-cells and ß-cell/8-cells. Conclusion: The morphometric data show a decrease rather than an increase in the number of IAPP-expressing cells in PC. Differences in abnormalities in type-2 diabetics and in zone B of PC tissue strongly argue against the role of type 2 diabetes in PC.

Objective To determine the incidence of pancreatic cancer in new-onset type 2 diabetic patients by measuring the serum level of CA 19-9 and performing abdominal ultrasonography (US). Patients and methods Consecutive type 2 diabetic patients in whom diabetes was diagnosed within 36 months were included in this prospective study. Serum CA 19-9 measurement and US were performed in all patients. If any of two was positive, abdominal computer tomography (CT) was carried out. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration or direct surgical referral was performed on patients with CT-identified lesions. Results A total of 115 patients were enrolled. CA 19-9 was elevated in 10 patients but pancreatic cancer diagnosed in neither of them. Pancreatic cancer was revealed by morphological means in three patients without elevated CA 19-9 level. The sensitivity, specificity, positive-, negative predictive values and validity were 0%, 90.4%, 0%, 97.9% and 87.9% for CA 19-9, 66.7%, 100%, 100%, 99% and 99% for US, respectively. The value of the Standardized Incidence Ratio for pancreatic cancer in new-onset type-2 diabetic patients was 198.6 (95% CI = 6.25-46.9). Conclusions The prevalence of pancreatic cancer in patients with new-onset type-2 diabetes is significantly higher than that in the general population and screening is beneficial for detecting PaC in this patient population. CA 19-9 and US is not reliable screening modality for pancreatic cancer screening in this population. © 2015, IAP and EPC. Published by Elsevier India, a division of Reed Elsevier India Pvt. Ltd.

The number of patients suffering from pancreatic cancer in recent years has continued to increase dramatically. Carbohydrate antigen 19-9 is an established biomarker of pancreatic cancer, but it does not have sufficient ability to detect pancreatic cancer at an early stage. We focused on angiopoietin-like protein 2 (ANGPTL2), which has been reported to be related to chronic inflammation and Type 2 diabetes mellitus. In this study, whether ANGPTL2 can detect early pancreatic cancer was evaluated. It was found that the concentration of serum ANGPTL2 was significantly higher in pancreatic cancer patients and tumor stage 0-I patients than in healthy individuals (5.84 ± 1.82 ng/mL vs 3.61 ± 0.64 ng/mL; P < 0.001) (5.68 ± 0.79 ng/mL vs 3.61 ± 0.64 ng/mL; P = 0.010). In addition, the diagnostic capability of serum ANGPTL2 levels for pancreatic cancer was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) for ANGPTL2 was 0.906 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.815-0.997; P < 0.001). To identify the risk factors for pancreatic cancer, multivariate regression models were used. Ten factors were included, and increasing age (odds ratio (OR), 1.318, 95% CI, 1.058-1.642; P = 0.014) and high ANGPTL2 levels (OR, 22.219, 95% CI, 1.962-251.659, P = 0.012) were found to be independent risk factors for pancreatic cancer, with ANGPTL2 having the strongest relationship. In addition, serum ANGPTL2 levels were strongly correlated with inflammatory markers, with blood sugar levels showing the strongest correlation with serum ANGPTL2 levels. In conclusion, this study suggested that an elevated serum ANGPTL2 level has the potential to be a biomarker capable of early detection of pancreatic cancer, and it was correlated with inflammation of the pancreas and the risk of developing diabetes mellitus. © Ivyspring International Publisher.

Despite the studies performed, the mechanism behind this phenomenon remains ambiguous. In this study, we explored the effects of two types of exosomes released by murine pancreatic cancer and ductal epithelial cells on murine skeletal muscle cells. The results show that PC-derived exosomes can readily enter C2C12 myotubes, triggering lipidosis and glucose intake inhibition. We also demonstrate that PC-derived exosomes can inhibit insulin and PI3K/Akt signalling, in which insulin-induced FoxO1 nuclear exclusion is preserved and Glut4 trafficking is impaired. Microarray and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses show that exosomal microRNAs (miRNAs) probably play key roles in this process, an assumption that is corroborated by in vitro studies. These results confirm that the insulin resistance (IR) of skeletal muscle cells is governed by PC-derived exosomes through the insulin and PI3K/Akt/FoxO1 signalling pathways, where exosomal miRNAs potentially contribute to this phenomenon. These novel findings pave the way towards a comprehensive understanding of the cancer theories: ""metabolic reprogramming"" and ""metabolic crosstalk"". © 2017 The Author(s).","","Animals; Carcinoma, Pancreatic Ductal; Cell Communication; Cell Line, Transformed; Exosomes; Female; Forkhead Box Protein O1; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Insulin Resistance; Insulin-Secreting Cells; Mice; Mice, Nude; Muscle, Skeletal; Myoblasts; Pancreatic Neoplasms; Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt; Signal Transduction; Tumor Cells, Cultured; Foxo1 protein, mouse; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; Pik3cd protein, mouse; protein kinase B; transcription factor FKHR; animal; cell communication; chemistry; exosome; female; gene expression regulation; genetics; insulin resistance; metabolism; mouse; myoblast; nude mouse; pancreas carcinoma; pancreas islet beta cell; pancreas tumor; pathology; signal transduction; skeletal muscle; transformed cell line; transplantation; tumor cell culture","","phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase, 115926-52-8; protein kinase B, 148640-14-6; Forkhead Box Protein O1, ; Foxo1 protein, mouse, ; Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases, ; Pik3cd protein, mouse, ; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt, ","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (81100549, 81172158, 81272332, 81301889, 81570698); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province, ZJNSF, (LY16H070003); Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province, ZJNSF; Zhejiang University, ZJU","This work was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (no. 81570698, 81272332, 81301889, 81100549 and 81172158) and Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China (no.

Given that these risk factors are correlated, separating out causal from confounded effects is challenging. Mendelian randomization (MR), or the use of genetic instrumental variables, may facilitate the identification of the metabolic drivers of pancreatic cancer. Methods: We identified genetic instruments for obesity, body shape, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes in order to evaluate their causal role in pancreatic cancer etiology. These instruments were analyzed in relation to risk using a likelihood-based MR approach within a series of 7110 pancreatic cancer patients and 7264 control subjects using genome-wide data from the Pancreatic Cancer Cohort Consortium (PanScan) and the Pancreatic Cancer Case-Control Consortium (PanC4). Potential unknown pleiotropic effects were assessed using a weighted median approach and MR-Egger sensitivity analyses. Results: Results indicated a robust causal association of increasing body mass index (BMI) with pancreatic cancer risk (odds ratio [OR] = 1.34, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.09 to 1.65, for each standard deviation increase in BMI [4.6 kg/m2]). There was also evidence that genetically increased fasting insulin levels were causally associated with an increased risk of pancreatic cancer (OR = 1.66, 95% CI = 1.05 to 2.63, per SD [44.4 pmol/L]). Notably, no evidence of a causal relationship was observed for type 2 diabetes, nor for dyslipidemia. Sensitivity analyses did not indicate that pleiotropy was an important source of bias. Conclusions: Our results suggest a causal role of BMI and fasting insulin in pancreatic cancer etiology. © The Author 2017.","","Body Mass Index; Case-Control Studies; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Energy Metabolism;

Materials and Methods: For the period January 1, 2007 to May 1, 2017, the PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register and ClininalTrials.gov databases were searched for RCTs in people with T2DM that compared incretin drugs with placebo or other antidiabetic drugs, with treatment and follow-up durations of ≥52 weeks. Two reviewers screened the studies, extracted the data and assessed the risk of bias independently and in duplicate. Results: A total of 33 studies (n = 79 971), including the 6 CVOTs, with 87 pancreatic cancer events were identified. Overall, the pancreatic cancer risk was not increased in patients administered incretin drugs compared with controls (Peto odds ratio [OR] 0.67, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.44-1.02). In the 6 CVOTs, 79 pancreatic cancer events were identified in 55 248 participants. Pooled estimates of the 6 CVOTs showed an identical tendency (Peto OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.42-1.01). Notably, in the subgroup of participants who received treatment and follow-up for ≥104 weeks, 84 pancreatic cancer events were identified in 59 919 participants, and a lower risk of pancreatic cancer was associated with incretin-based therapies (Peto OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.41-0.95). Conclusions: Treatment with incretin drugs was not associated with an increased risk of pancreatic cancer in people with T2DM. Instead, it might protect against pancreatic malignancy in patients treated for ≥104 weeks. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors; GLP-1 analogue; incretins; meta-analysis; type 2 diabetes","Adult; Aged; Databases, Factual; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Dipeptidyl-Peptidase IV Inhibitors; Drug Therapy, Combination; Female; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Incretins; Male; Middle Aged; Pancreatic Neoplasms; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Risk Factors; albiglutide; alogliptin; antidiabetic agent; dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor; dulaglutide; empagliflozin; exendin 4; glimepiride; glipizide; incretin; insulin; insulin aspart; insulin glargine; insulin lispro; linagliptin; liraglutide; lixisenatide; metformin; pioglitazone; saxagliptin; semaglutide; sitagliptin; antidiabetic agent; dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor; incretin; Article; cancer risk; disease association; follow up; human; meta analysis; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; pancreas cancer; randomized controlled trial (topic); systematic review; adult; aged; chemically induced; combination drug therapy; complication; factual database; female; male; middle aged; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; pancreas tumor; risk factor; statistics and numerical data","","albiglutide, 782500-75-8; alogliptin, 850649-61-5, 850649-62-6; dulaglutide, 923950-08-7; empagliflozin, 864070-44-0; exendin 4, 141732-76-5, 141758-74-9; glimepiride, 93479-97-1; glipizide, 29094-61-9; insulin, 9004-10-8; insulin aspart, 116094-23-6; insulin glargine, 160337-95-1; insulin lispro, 133107-64-9; linagliptin, 668270-12-0; liraglutide, 204656-20-2; lixisenatide, 320367-13-3; metformin, 1115-70-4, 657-24-9; pioglitazone, 105355-27-9, 111025-46-8; saxagliptin, 361442-04-8, 945667-22-1; semaglutide, 910463-68-2; sitagliptin, 486460-32-6, 654671-78-0, 654671-77-9; Dipeptidyl-Peptidase IV Inhibitors, ; Hypoglycemic Agents, ; Incretins, ","","","Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics; AstraZeneca; EMD Serono; Merck Sharp and Dohme, MSD; University of Maryland School of Public Health, SPH; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (81400767, 81401142, 81570692, 81670701); Peking University Health Science Center, PKUHSC","Funding text 1: We thank PhD candidate Jun Yang, from the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Peking University Health Science Centre, for his help with the literature screening.

We used two models to predict pancreatic cancer risk among patients with T2DM. Methods: The original data used for this investigation were retrieved from the National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan. The prediction models included the available possible risk factors for pancreatic cancer. The data were split into training and test sets: 97.5% of the data were used as the training set and 2.5% of the data were used as the test set. Logistic regression (LR) and artificial neural network (ANN) models were implemented using Python (Version 3.7.0). The F1, precision, and recall were compared between the LR and the ANN models. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves of the prediction models were also compared. Results: The metrics used in this study indicated that the LR model more accurately predicted pancreatic cancer than the ANN model. For the LR model, the area under the ROC curve in the prediction of pancreatic cancer was 0.727, indicating a good fit. Conclusion: Using this LR model, our results suggested that we could appropriately predict pancreatic cancer risk in patients with T2DM in Taiwan. © 2018 Hsieh et al.","Artificial neural networ; Logistic regression; Pancreatic cancer; Type 2 diabetes","accuracy; adult; aged; area under the curve; Article; artificial neural network; cancer risk; comorbidity; controlled study; female; human; major clinical study; male; middle aged; national health insurance; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; pancreas cancer; prediction; process development; receiver operating characteristic; risk assessment; statistical model; Taiwan; young adult","","","","","Katsuzo and Kiyo Aoshima Memorial Funds; MOST Clinical Trial Consortium for Stroke; Tseng-Lien Lin Foundation; Ministry of Health and Welfare, MOHW; Academia Sinica, (BM10701010021); Ministry of Health and Welfare, MOHW, (MOHW107-TDU-B-212-123004); China Medical University Hospital, CMUH, (DMR-107-192); Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, MOST, (107-2321-B-039 -004-)","Funding text 1: This work was supported by grants from the Ministry of Health and Welzare, Tai wan (MOHW107-TDU-B-212-123004), China Medical University Hospital (DMR-107-192), Academia Sinica Stroke Biosignature Project (BM10701010021), MOST Clinical Trial Consortium for Stroke (MOST 107-2321-B-039-004-), Tseng-Lien Lin Foundation, Taichung, Taiwan, and Katsuzo and Kiyo Aoshima Memorial Funds, Japan.

We evaluated whether any reported genetic risk variants of either disease found by genome-wide association studies reciprocally confer susceptibility. Methods: Data that were generated in previous genome-wide association studies (GENEVA Type 2 Diabetes; PanScan) were obtained through the National Institutes of Health database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP). Using the PanScan datasets, we tested for association of 38 variants within 37 genomic regions known to be susceptibility factors for type 2 diabetes. We further examined whether type 2 diabetes variants predispose to pancreatic cancer risk stratified by diabetes status. Correspondingly, we examined the association of fourteen pancreatic cancer susceptibility variants within eight genomic regions in the GENEVA Type 2 Diabetes dataset. Results: Four plausible associations of diabetes variants and pancreatic cancer risk were detected at a significance threshold of p = 0.05, and one pancreatic cancer susceptibility variant was associated with diabetes risk at threshold of p = 0.05, but none remained significant after correction for multiple comparisons. Conclusion: Currently identified GWAS susceptibility variants are unlikely to explain the potential shared genetic etiology between Type 2 diabetes and pancreatic cancer. © 2015 PLOS ONE.","","Alleles; Case-Control Studies; Cohort Studies; Databases, Factual; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Disease Susceptibility; Gene Frequency; Genome-Wide Association Study; Genotype; Humans; Odds Ratio; Pancreatic Neoplasms; Phenotype; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Risk Factors; Article; cancer susceptibility; controlled study; genetic association; genetic predisposition; genetic risk; genetic variability; human; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; pancreas cancer; phenotype; risk factor; single nucleotide polymorphism; allele; case control study; cohort analysis; complication; disease predisposition; factual database; gene frequency; genetics; genome-wide association study; genotype; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; odds ratio; Pancreatic Neoplasms","","","","","National Cancer Institute, (P50CA102701, R01CA97075); National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, (TL1TR000137); National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, NCATS, (UL1TR000135)","","Huxley R., Ansary-Moghaddam A., Berrington De-Gonzalez A., Barzi F., Woodward M., Type-II diabetes and pancreatic cancer: A meta-analysis of 36 studies, British Journal of Cancer, 92, pp. 2076-2083, (2005); Everhart J., Wright D., Diabetes mellitus as a risk factor for pancreatic cancer.

Prior studies find type 2 diabetes and gastric and hepatobiliary comorbidities heightening risk of pancreatic cancer. Yet joint association of type 2 diabetes mellitus and gastric and hepatobiliary comorbidities on pancreatic cancer risk has not been assessed. Methods: This study rates independent/joint effects of type 2 diabetes as well as gastric and hepatobiliary comorbidity on pancreatic cancer risk for a retrospective population-based cohort of 166 850 type 2 diabetics identified in 1997-1998 and followed for 10-11 years, comparing their cancer incidence with that of 166 850 non-diabetics matched for age, gender, and locale. Time-dependent Cox's proportional hazards model evaluted joint association of type 2 diabetes and chronic conditions on pancreatic cancer risk.Results:A total of 1178 subjects were newly diagnosed with pancreatic cancer during follow-up, with incidence rates of 0.49 per 1000 person-years in type 2 diabetes and 0.26 per 1000 person-years in the non-diabetics. We observed greater magnitude of hazard ratios (HRs) of pancreatic cancer for patients with type 2 diabetes along with acute alcoholic hepatitis, acute pancreatitis, cholecystitis, and gastric ulcer compared with patients without type 2 diabetes or counterpart comorbidity (HR: 1.36, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.19-1.56; 1.74, 1.23-2.45; 9.18, 7.44-11.33; and 2.31, 1.98-2.70, respectively). Main effects of type 2 diabetes were all statistically with narrow 95% CI and remained similar across risk stratification with various comorbidities: range 1.59-1.80.Conclusions:Our study demonstrates that pre-existing type 2 diabetes, acute alcoholic hepatitis, acute pancreatitis, cholecystitis, and gastric ulcer independently or jointly predict subsequent pancreatic cancer risk. Clinicians must recognise burden of these gastric and hepatobiliary comorbidities and keep clinically vigilant for their diagnosis. © 2014 Cancer Research UK.","gastric diseases; hepatobiliary diseases; pancreatic cancer; type 2 diabetes","Adult; Aged; Cohort Studies; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Liver Diseases; Male; Middle Aged; Pancreatic Neoplasms; Pancreatitis; Proportional Hazards Models; Risk; Stomach Diseases; acute pancreatitis; adult; alcohol liver disease; alcoholism; Article; caloric intake; cancer incidence; cancer risk; cholecystitis; cholelithiasis; comorbidity; controlled study; duodenum ulcer; female; follow up; hepatitis B; hepatobiliary disease; human; International Classification of Diseases; major clinical study; male; metabolic disorder; middle aged; morbid obesity; national health insurance; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; pancreas cancer; physical inactivity; priority journal; proportional hazards model; risk assessment; stomach ulcer; aged; cohort analysis; complication; liver disease; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; Pancreatic Neoplasms; pancreatitis; risk; stomach disease","","","","","China Medical University Hospital Cancer Research Center of Excellence, (MOHW103-TD-B-111-03); Ministry of Health and Welfare, MOHW, (MOHW103-TDU-B-212-113002); Ministry of Education, MOE; China Medical University, Taiwan, CMU","This study is supported in part by Taiwan Ministry of Health and Welfare Clinical Trial and Research Center of Excellence (MOHW103-TDU-B-212-113002), Health and welfare surcharge of tobacco products, China Medical University Hospital Cancer Research Center of Excellence (MOHW103-TD-B-111-03, Taiwan) and China Medical University under the Aim for Top University Plan of the Ministry of Education, Taiwan.","Atchison E.A., Gridley G., Carreon J.D., Leitzmann M.F., McGlynn K.A., Risk of cancer in a large cohort of U.S, Veterans with Diabetes.

This study examines the risk of pancreatic cancer with GLP-1 RA use in patients with T2DM. Methods: We analyzed TriNetX’s deidentified research database using the U.S. Collaborative Network comprising 62 healthcare organizations across the U.S.A. Patients with T2DM were split into two cohorts: one receiving GLP-1 RAs, and one not receiving GLP-1 RAs. We excluded patients with known risk factors for pancreatic cancer, including pancreatic cysts, a personal or family history of BRCA1, BRCA2, CDKN2A, KRAS, MEN1, MLH1, MSH2, NOTCH1, PALB2, PMS2, and PRSS1S genes, family history of pancreatic cancer, and VHL syndrome. Using a 1:1 propensity score-matching model based on baseline characteristics and comorbidities, we created comparable cohorts. We then compared the rate of pancreatic cancer between the two cohorts at a 7-year interval. Results: Out of 7,146,015 identified patients with T2DM, 10.3% were on a GLP-1 RA and 89.7% were not. Post-PSM, 721,110 patients were in each group. Patients on GLP-1 RAs had a 0.1% risk compared to a 0.2% risk of pancreatic cancer in the 7-year timeframe. Conclusion: The use of GLP-1 RAs in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) does not appear to substantially elevate the risk of pancreatic cancer; in fact, it may potentially exert a protective effect. © 2024 by the authors.","diabetes; GLP-1 receptor agonists; pancreatic cancer","albiglutide; BRCA1 protein; BRCA2 protein; cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 2A; dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor; DNA mismatch repair protein MSH2; dulaglutide; exendin 4; glucagon like peptide 1 receptor agonist; hemoglobin A1c; insulin; liraglutide; lixisenatide; menin (protein); metformin; mismatch repair protein PMS2; MutL protein homolog 1; Notch1 receptor; partner and localizer of BRCA2; semaglutide; adult; aged; Article; body mass; cancer risk; cohort analysis; familial atypical multiple mole melanoma syndrome; female; gene; gene mutation; health care organization; hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome; human; major clinical study; male; middle aged; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; oncogene K ras; pancreas cancer; pancreatitis; propensity score; PRSS1S gene","","albiglutide, 782500-75-8; DNA mismatch repair protein MSH2, 153700-72-2; dulaglutide, 923950-08-7; exendin 4, 141732-76-5, 141758-74-9, 286014-72-0, 335149-21-8; hemoglobin A1c, 62572-11-6; insulin, 9004-10-8; liraglutide, 204656-20-2; lixisenatide, 320367-13-3; metformin, 1115-70-4, 657-24-9; MutL protein homolog 1, 155577-96-1; semaglutide, 910463-68-2","","","","","Drug Safety Communication: FDA Investigating Reports of Possible Increased Risk of Pancreatitis and Pre-Cancerous Findings of the Pancreas from Incretin Mimetic Drugs for Type 2 Diabetes.

However, the mechanisms behind this epidemiological association remain unclear. Whether it is hyperglycemia or insulin resistance that increases the risk of pancreatic adenocarcinoma is a question that has yet to be settled. A new study by Kim et al published in The American Journal of Gastroenterology shows that the presence of insulin resistance independently increases pancreatic cancer mortality even in individuals without diabetes and hyperglycemia.

Methods: The study population comprised 45 PC patients with type 2 diabetes, 50 patients with type 2 diabetes alone, and 60 control subjects. All data was mined from the electronic records of the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University in Nanning, Guangxi, China. Results: We found that the NLRs and PLR of PC patients with type 2 diabetes were higher compared to patients with type 2 diabetes alone and healthy subjects. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis for the diagnosis of PC in type 2 diabetic patients revealed that the combination of NLR and CA199 had higher specificity than either NLR or CA199 alone, while the combination of PLR and CA199 had higher sensitivity than either PLR or CA199 alone. The area under the ROC curve (AUROC) for PLR combined with CA199 was significantly larger than CA199 alone, and the AUROC for NLR combined with CA199 was also larger than CA199 alone, although this difference was not significant. Conclusions: Combining PLR and CA199 values could allow earlier diagnosis of PC in type 2 diabetic patients. © 2019 Verlag Klinisches Labor GmbH.

This nationwide population-based study included women aged 14-55 who gave birth between 1st January 2008 and 31 December 2009. The women were followed-up epidemiologically for eight years. Survival analyses using Cox regression models, adjusted for age, subsequent type 2 diabetes, and tobacco consumption, were performed on the time to occurrence of hospitalization for PC. The onset of GDM, tobacco consumption and subsequent type 2 diabetes were considered as time-dependent variables. Among 1,352,560 women included, 95,314 had a history of GDM (7.05%) and 126 women were hospitalized for PC (0.01%). Over the eight years of follow-up, GDM was significantly associated with a higher risk of hospitalization with PC in the first Cox regression model adjusted for age and subsequent type 2 diabetes (HR = 1.81 95% CI [1.06-3.10]). The second Cox regression model adjusted for the same covariates, plus tobacco consumption, showed that GDM was still significantly associated with a higher risk of hospitalization for PC with nearly the same estimated risk (HR = 1.77 95% CI [1.03-3.03]). Gestational diabetes was significantly associated with a greater risk of hospital admission for pancreatic cancer within eight years, regardless of subsequent type 2 diabetes. © 2021 by the authors.","Gestational diabetes mellitus; Medico-administrative database; National study; Pancreas cancer; Postpartum follow-up; Type 2 diabetes","adolescent; adult; age; Article; cancer risk; cohort analysis; controlled study; disease association; disease severity; female; follow up; France; high risk patient; hospitalization; human; major clinical study; medical history; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; outcome assessment; pancreas cancer; pregnancy diabetes mellitus; retrospective study; risk assessment; survival rate; tobacco consumption; young adult","","","","","","","Drouillard A., Manfredi S., Lepage C., Bouvier A.-M., Epidemiology of pancreatic cancer, Bull Cancer.

Earlier studies of pancreatic adverse events have reported conflicting results. Methods: This study analyzed Korean National Health Insurance Service data from January 2009 to December 2012. Patients who had type 2 diabetes mellitus and took two or more oral glucose-lowering drugs (GLDs) were included. Patients prescribed DPP-4 inhibitors (n=51,482) or other GLDs (n=51,482) were matched at a 1:1 ratio using propensity score matching. The risk of pancreatic cancer was calculated using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional-hazards regression analysis. Results: During a median follow-up period of 7.95 years, 1,051 new cases of pancreatic cancer were identified. The adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for DPP-4 inhibitor use was 0.99 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.88 to 1.12) compared with the other GLD group. In an analysis limited to cases diagnosed with pancreatic cancer during hospitalization, the adjusted HR for the use of DPP-4 inhibitors was 1.00 (95% CI, 0.86 to 1.17) compared with patients who took other GLDs. Using the other GLD group as the reference group, no trend was observed for elevated pancreatic cancer risk with increased DPP-4 inhibitor exposure. Conclusion: In this population-based cohort study, DPP-4 inhibitor use over the course of relatively long-term follow-up showed no significant association with an elevated risk of pancreatic cancer.

To begin, we conducted a literature review to identify miRNAs associated with the PC-T2D link. However, we found limited research on this specific association, with most studies focusing on the antitumor effects of metformin. Furthermore, we performed a bioinformatics analysis to identify new potential miRNAs that might be relevant in the context of PC-T2D. First, we identified miRNAs and gene expression alterations common to both diseases using publicly available datasets. Subsequently, we performed an integrative analysis between the identified miRNAs and genes alterations. As a result, we identified nine miRNAs that could potentially play an important role in the interplay between PC and T2D. These miRNAs have the potential to influence nearby cells and distant tissues, affecting critical processes like extracellular matrix remodeling and cell adhesion, ultimately contributing to the development of T2D or PC. Taken together, these analyses underscore the importance of further exploring the role of miRNAs in the complex interplay of PC and T2D. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","microRNA; Pancreatic cancer; Type 2 diabetes","Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Gene Expression Regulation; Humans; Metformin; MicroRNAs; Pancreatic Neoplasms; biological marker; metformin; microRNA; small untranslated RNA; metformin; microRNA; antineoplastic activity; bioinformatics; cancer tissue; cell adhesion; clinical research; disease association; down regulation; extracellular matrix; gene control; gene expression; gene function; gene targeting; genetic code; genetic identification; human; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; pancreas cancer; pathogenesis; Review; tumor cell; gene expression regulation; genetics; metabolism; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; pancreas tumor","","metformin, 1115-70-4, 657-24-9; Metformin, ; MicroRNAs, ","","","Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas, CONICET","BM and MCA are career investigators from the Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas of Argentina ( CONICET ), and MVM is supported by postdoctoral fellowship from the CONICET .

Methods: This retrospective cohort study using the UK General Practice Research Database compared pancreatic cancer incidence and risk in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) versus patients without diabetes. Multivariate Cox regression adjusting for age, sex, history of chronic pancreatitis, gallbladder disease, obesity, smoking and alcohol use andCharlson comorbidity index was used to estimate hazard ratio (HR) [95% confidence interval, CI]. Analyses were repeated using various time windows for diabetes duration. Results: A total of 1903 incident pancreatic cancers were identified, 436 in patients with T2DM (78.76 per 100 000 person-years [95% CI: 71.54, 86.51]) and 1467 in patients without diabetes (11.46 per 100 000 person-years [10.88, 12.06]). Pancreatic cancer risk was significant for T2DM (adjusted HR 1.80 [1.52, 2.14]), increasing age, history of chronic pancreatitis and tobacco use. For patients with chronic pancreatitis and T2DM, the adjusted HR was 12.12 [6.02, 24.40]. Incidence was highest in patients with =5 year duration of T2DM. In patient populations with duration of T2DM ranging from =1 to =5 years, adjusted HRs remained significant but point estimates attenuated slightly with longer duration of T2DM. Conclusions: Patients with T2DM had an 80% increased risk of pancreatic cancer versus patients without diabetes. Patients with T2DM and chronic pancreatitis were 12 times more likely to develop pancreatic cancer. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Pancreatic cancer; Reverse causality; Type 2 diabetes","Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Alcohol Drinking; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Female; Gallstones; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Male; Middle Aged; Pancreatic Neoplasms; Pancreatitis, Chronic; Proportional Hazards Models; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Smoking; Time Factors; alcohol; antidiabetic agent; adult; aged; alcohol consumption; article; cancer risk; Charlson Comorbidity Index; chronic pancreatitis; cohort analysis; controlled study; disease association; disease duration; electronic medical record; female; gallbladder disease; groups by age; hazard ratio; human; major clinical study; male; medical history; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; pancreas cancer; retrospective study; sex; smoking; age; Article; cancer incidence; high risk population; pancreas cancer; tobacco use; United Kingdom; complication; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; drinking behavior; gallstone; middle aged; Pancreatic Neoplasms; Pancreatitis, Chronic; pathophysiology; proportional hazards model; risk factor; time; very elderly","","alcohol, 64-17-5; Hypoglycemic Agents, ","","","","","Ferlay J., Shin H.R., Bray F., Forman D., Mathers C., Parkin D.M., GLOBOCAN 2008 v1.2, Cancer Incidence and Mortality Worldwide: IARC CancerBase No. 10, (2010); Lowenfels A.B., Maisonneuve P., Epidemiology and risk factors for pancreatic cancer, Best Pract Res Clin Gastroenterol, 20, pp. 197-209, (2006); Erickson R.A., Larson C.R., Shabahang M., Pancreatic Cancer, eMedicine Oncology, (2011); Hidalgo M., Pancreatic cancer, N Engl J Med, 362, pp. 1605-1617, (2010); Vincent A., Herman J., Schulick R., Hruban R.H., Goggins M., Pancreatic cancer, Lancet, 378, pp. 607-620, (2011); Hassan M.M., Bondy M.L., Wolff R.A., Et al., Risk factors for pancreatic cancer: case-control study, Am J Gastroenterol, 102, pp. 2696-2707, (2007); Jiao L., Silverman D.T., Schairer C., Et al., Alcohol use and risk of pancreatic cancer: the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study, Am J Epidemiol, 169, pp. 1043-1051, (2009); Rohrmann S., Linseisen J., Vrieling A., Et al., Ethanol intake and the risk of pancreatic cancer in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC), Cancer Causes Control, 20, pp. 785-794, (2009); Chari S.T., Leibson C.L., Rabe K.G., Ransom J., de Andrade M., Petersen G.M., Probability of pancreatic cancer following diabetes: a population-based study, Gastroenterology, 129, pp. 504-511, (2005); Chen H.F., Chen P., Li C.Y., Risk of malignant neoplasm of the pancreas in relation to diabetes: a population-based study in Taiwan, Diabetes Care, 34, pp. 1177-1179, (2011); Larsson S.C., Permert J., Hakansson N., Naslund I., Bergkvist L., Wolk A., Overall obesity, abdominal adiposity, diabetes and cigarette smoking in relation to the risk of pancreatic cancer in two Swedish population-based cohorts, Br J Cancer, 93, pp. 1310-1315, (2005); Li C., Balluz L.S., Ford E.S., Okoro C.A., Tsai J., Zhao G., Association between diagnosed diabetes and self-reported cancer among U.S. adults: findings from the 2009 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, Diabetes Care, 34, pp. 1365-1368, (2011); Rosato V., Tavani A., Bosetti C., Et al., Metabolic syndrome and pancreatic cancer risk: a case-control study in Italy and meta-analysis, Metabolism, 60, pp. 1372-1378, (2011); Li D., Morris J.S., Liu J., Et al., Body mass index and risk, age of onset, and survival in patients with pancreatic cancer, JAMA, 301, pp. 2553-2562, (2009); Patel A.V., Rodriguez C., Bernstein L., Chao A., Thun M.J., Calle E.E., Obesity, recreational physical activity, and risk of pancreatic cancer in a large U.S. Cohort, Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev, 14, pp. 459-466, (2005); Lowenfels A.B., Maisonneuve P., Cavallini G., Et al., Pancreatitis and the risk of pancreatic cancer.

Various genetic and environmental factors cause both these global chronic diseases. The mechanisms that define their relationships are complex and poorly understood. Recent studies have implicated that metabolic abnormalities, including hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia, could lead to cell damage responses, cell transformation, and increased cancer risk. Hence, these kinds of abnormalities following molecular events could be essential to develop our understanding of this complicated link. Among different molecular events, focusing on shared signaling pathways including metabolic (PI3K/Akt/mTOR) and mitogenic (MAPK) pathways in addition to regulatory mechanisms of gene expression such as those involved in non-coding RNAs (miRNAs, circRNAs, and lncRNAs) could be considered as powerful tools to describe this association. A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in the development of type 2 diabetes and pancreatic cancer would help us to find a new research area for developing therapeutic and preventive strategies. For this purpose, in this review, we focused on the shared molecular events resulting in type 2 diabetes and pancreatic cancer. First, a comprehensive literature review was performed to determine similar molecular pathways and non-coding RNAs; then, the final results were discussed in more detail. © 2021 The Authors.

Methods: A systematic literature search was performed on PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Highwire, CBM, CNKI, Wanfang, VIP databases. Cohort or case control studies of metformin and risk of pancreatic cancer in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were included. The Newcastle-Ottaua Scale score was used for quality evaluation and meta-analysis was performed using RevMan5.2 Meta-analysis software. Results: Nine studies were included in this study. The results showed that the risk of pancreatic cancer was significantly reduced in metformin treatment group (RR=0.61, 95% CI (0.55, 0.67), P<0.001). Subgroup analysis showed that patients with type 2 diabetes in treatment with metformin and sulfonylurea (RR=0.57, 95% CI (0.51, 0.64),P<0.001) or insulin (RR=0.61, 95% CI (0.53, 0.70), P<0.001) could reduce the risk of pancreatic cancer.

We performed a prospective study to examine whether adherence to this dietary pattern is associated with a reduced risk of pancreatic cancer. Methods: A population-based cohort of 101,729 American adults was identified. A dietary diabetes risk reduction score was computed to reflect adherence to this dietary pattern, with higher scores representing greater adherence. Cox regression was used to compute hazard ratios (HRs) for pancreatic cancer incidence. Prespecified subgroup analyses were used to identify the potential effect modifiers. Results: After an average follow-up of 8.86 years (900,871.67 person-years), a total of 402 pancreatic cancer cases were observed. In the fully adjusted model, participants in the highest quartile of dietary diabetes risk reduction score were found to have a reduced risk of pancreatic cancer compared with those in the lowest quartile [HRquartiles 4 versus 1: 0.62; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.44, 0.86; Ptrend = 0.004], which remained in a series of sensitivity analyses. Subgroup analyses further found that this favorable association was more pronounced in current or former smokers (HRquartiles 4 versus 1: 0.48; 95% CI: 0.30, 0.77) than in never smokers (HRquartiles 4 versus 1: 0.71; 95% CI: 0.44, 1.15), although the interaction test did not reach statistical significance (Pinteraction = 0.095). Conclusions: Greater adherence to type 2 diabetes prevention diet is associated with a lower risk of pancreatic cancer in this US population. More studies are needed to confirm our findings. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism","Cancer prevention; Dietary pattern; Epidemiology; Pancreatic cancer","Aged; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Diet, Healthy; Feeding Behavior; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Guideline Adherence; Humans; Incidence; Male; Middle Aged; Nutrition Policy; Pancreatic Neoplasms; Proportional Hazards Models; Prospective Studies; Risk Factors; Risk Reduction Behavior; United States; adult; aged; aging; American; Article; cancer risk; cohort analysis; comparative study; controlled study; dietary pattern; female; follow up; human; major clinical study; male; never smoker; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; observational study; pancreas cancer; patient compliance; prospective study; randomized controlled trial; risk reduction; sensitivity analysis; United States; clinical trial; feeding behavior; incidence; middle aged; multicenter study; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nutrition policy; pancreas tumor; procedures; proportional hazards model; protocol compliance; risk factor","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (82002615); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","This study was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 82002615 ).

Individuals with new-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus (NOD) are the largest high-risk group for PDAC. To facilitate screening, we sought biomarkers capable of stratifying NOD subjects into those with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and those with the less prevalent PDAC-related diabetes (PDAC-DM), a form of type 3c DM commonly misdiagnosed as T2DM. Methods: Using mass spectrometry- and immunoassay-based methodologies in a multi-stage analysis of independent sample sets (n=443 samples), blood levels of 264 proteins were considered using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis, literature review and targeted training and validation. Findings: Of 30 candidate biomarkers evaluated in up to four independent patient sets, 12 showed statistically significant differences in levels between PDAC-DM and T2DM. The combination of adiponectin and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) showed strong diagnostic potential, (AUC of 0.91; 95% CI: 0.84-0.99) for the distinction of T3cDM from T2DM. Interpretation: Adiponectin and IL-1Ra warrant further consideration for use in screening for PDAC in individuals newly-diagnosed with T2DM.

Methods: Among populations who underwent a biennial or annual evaluation provided by the National Health Insurance Service Database of Claims between 2006 and 2015, data were evaluated from the medical records of 34.2 million individuals aged 30 years and over. Results: The annual incidence rate (IR; per 100,000) of pancreatic cancer in 2006 was 5.96, and the IR in 2015 increased to 8.92. The IRs increased consistently and significantly with age (p for trend < 0.0001). The incidence rate ratio (IRR; after adjusting for age and sex) of pancreatic cancer was higher (about 1.5 times) in males than in females for all ages. In particular, the IR (15.8) of pancreatic cancer between 50 and 59 years in patients with diabetes was strikingly higher compared to that in patients without diabetes (IR 7.6). Furthermore, the pancreatic cancer IR (19.1) of men with diabetes between 50 and 59 years was similar to the IR (20.2) in women with diabetes between 60 and 69 years, and it was even greater than the IR (17.0) in non-diabetic women between 60 and 69 years. Conclusions: In middle-aged populations, men with type 2 diabetes had the highest relative risk. Their annual incidence rate of pancreatic cancer persistently increased and was higher by about 10–30% than in women with diabetes. © 2019, Springer-Verlag Italia S.r.l., part of Springer Nature.","Age-groups; Diabetes mellitus; National Health Insurance; Pancreatic neoplasms; Sex","Adult; Aged; Cohort Studies; Databases, Factual; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Early Detection of Cancer; Female; Humans; Incidence; Male; Middle Aged; Pancreatic Neoplasms; Republic of Korea; adult; age; aged; Article; cancer incidence; cancer screening; cohort analysis; human; ICD-10; major clinical study; male; medical record review; middle aged; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; pancreas cancer; population research; priority journal; risk assessment; sex difference; South Korea; complication; early cancer diagnosis; factual database; female; incidence; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; pancreas tumor","","","","","Kangbuk Samsung Hospital"," This work was supported by the Medical Research Funds from Kangbuk Samsung Hospital (Seoul, Korea).

Liraglutide is one of several incretin-based agents that have been suggested to be associated with pancreatitis and pancreas cancer. The suspicion accelerated after publication of an autopsy study claiming increased incidences of several pathological changes in pancreata from patients with diabetes treated with incretin-based drugs.Areas covered: The aim of the present review is to give an overview of the pharmacology of liraglutide and provide a review of adverse reactions associated with liraglutide with a focus on the risk of pancreatitis and pancreas cancer.Expert opinion: When comprehensively reviewing the available literature, no clear and significant associations between liraglutide and pancreatitis and/or pancreas cancer seem evident. However, a recently published analysis suggests a trend toward a slightly elevated risk of pancreatitis with GLP-1 receptor agonists (including liraglutide), which may become statistical significant as more data become available. Well-established side effects are of gastrointestinal origin, typical mild-to-moderate and of transient character. The risk of hypoglycemia associated with liraglutide treatment is low. © 2015 Informa UK, Ltd.","Adverse reactions; Cancer; Glucagon-like peptide-1; Liraglutide; Pancreas; Pancreatitis; Type 2 diabetes","Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2;

Emerging evidence suggests the presence of lynch syndrome (LS) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) associated susceptibility to PC. This study presents integrated computational and systems biology approaches to identify the genetic risk factors underlying the association between PC, LS, and T2D. Patient data for these three diseases have been collected from NCBI and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) identified by the GREIN web platform. Furthermore, protein-protein interaction (PPI), gene ontology (GO), and signaling pathway networks were analyzed through STRING and DAVID databases, respectively. Autodock Vina has been used for prospective analysis of ligand-protein interaction. About 60 unique common DEGs were identified by statistical analysis. In addition to the utilization of five distinct algorithms within the Cytoscape framework, we have reported three potential target candidates: TNF, CXCL1, and TNFSF10. In particular, the immune and inflammatory response, the chemokine-mediated signaling pathway, rheumatoid arthritis, and IL-17 signaling pathways emerged as prominently enriched pathways. Furthermore, the interaction of 162 phytochemicals from Nigella sativa was assessed with the identified hub proteins. Among these, thujopsene emerged as a notable ligand candidate, demonstrating the most favorable binding energy against the TNF (−9.6 kca/mol TNFSF10 (−8.5 kcal/mol), and CXCL1 (−9.1 kcal/mol) proteins. Besides, pharmacokinetics, toxicity, and drug-likeness properties of the thujopsene ligand showed an acceptable range for selection of a drug candidate. Collectively, these findings shed light on the intricate interplay of genes, pathways, and potential therapeutic compounds, providing a basis for further exploration and validation in the context of relevant diseases. © 2024 The Authors","Inflammatory response; Nigella sativa; Pancreatic cancer; Thujopsene; TNF; Type 2 diabetes","amentoflavone; biological marker; CXCL1 chemokine; ELAV like protein 2; interleukin 17; plant medicinal product; thujopsene; tumor necrosis factor; tumor necrosis factor related apoptosis inducing ligand; unclassified drug; Article; binding affinity; bioinformatics; black cumin; Caco-2 cell line; chemokine signaling; controlled study; differential gene expression; disease association; down regulation; gene ontology; genetic risk; genetic screening; human; human cell; immune response; inflammation; interleukin signaling; KEGG; Lynch syndrome; molecular docking; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; pancreas cancer; pathway enrichment analysis; prospective study; protein protein interaction; rheumatoid arthritis; risk factor; signal transduction; systems biology; upregulation","","amentoflavone, 1617-53-4","Cytoscape","","Center for Advanced Bioinformatics and Artificial Intelligence Research, Department of Computer Science and Engineering; Islamic University","We thank our corresponding author and team member from the Center for Advanced Bioinformatics and Artificial Intelligence Research, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Islamic University, Kushtia 7003, Bangladesh.","Halbrook C.J., Lyssiotis C.A., di Magliano M.P., Maitra A., Pancreatic cancer: advances and challenges, Cell, 186, 8, pp. 1729-1754, (2023); Xu J.W., Yan Y., Wang L., Wu D., Ye N.K., Chen S.H., Li F., Marine bioactive compound dieckol induces apoptosis and inhibits the growth of human pancreatic cancer cells PANC ‐ 1, J Biochem Molecul Toxicol, 35, 2, (2020); Bray F., Laversanne M., Sung H., Ferlay J., Siegel R.L., Soerjomataram I., Jemal A., Global cancer statistics 2022: GLOBOCAN estimates of incidence and mortality worldwide for 36 cancers in 185 countries, CA Cancer J Clin, 74, 3, pp. 229-263, (2024); Hidalgo M., Pancreatic cancer.

However, to date, studies have investigated only the risk associated with either of them alone. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of pancreatitis and diabetes combined, as well as their temporal relationship, on the risk of pancreatic cancer. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Nationwide cancer registry was linked to hospital discharge and mortality data from 1998 to 2015 in New Zealand. Incidence of primary pancreatic cancer in the four study groups (type 2 diabetes [T2D] alone, pancreatitis alone, T2D followed by pancreatitis, and postpancreatitis diabetes mellitus [PPDM]) was identified. Multivariable Cox regression analyses were conducted, with T2D as the reference group. A head-to-head comparison between the T2D followed by pancreatitis and PPDM groups was also performed. RESULTS Among 139,843 individuals (735,541 person-years), 913 (0.7%) were diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. The proportion of pancreatic cancer was 3.1%, 2.3%, 2.0%, and 0.6% in individuals with PPDM, T2D followed by pancreatitis, pancreatitis alone, and T2D alone, respectively. PPDM (hazard ratio [HR] 6.94; 95% CI 4.09–11.77) and T2D followed by pancreatitis (HR 5.35; 95% CI 3.52–8.14) were associated with significantly higher risks of pancreatic cancer compared with T2D alone. In the head-to-head comparison, PPDM was associated with a higher risk of pancreatic cancer compared with T2D followed by pancreatitis (HR 2.35; 95% CI 1.12–4.93). CONCLUSIONS Pancreatitis significantly increases the risk of pancreatic cancer in individuals with diabetes. In particular, PPDM poses the highest risk for pancreatic cancer. © 2020 by the American Diabetes Association.","","Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cohort Studies; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Female; History, 20th Century; History, 21st Century; Humans; Incidence; Male; Middle Aged; Mortality; New Zealand; Pancreatic Neoplasms; Pancreatitis; Patient Discharge; Registries; Risk Factors; aged; Article; cancer diagnosis; cancer mortality; cancer registry; cancer risk; cohort analysis; controlled study; diabetes mellitus; disease association; female; high risk patient; hospital discharge; human; incidence; major clinical study; male; New Zealand; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; pancreas cancer; pancreatitis; patient information; postpancreatitis diabetes mellitus; primary tumor; risk assessment; adult; cancer incidence; cancer staging; hazard ratio; high risk patient; hospital mortality; pancreas cancer; pancreas surgery; pancreatitis; trend study; complication; history; middle aged; mortality; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; pancreas tumor; pancreatitis; register; risk factor; very elderly","","","","","Royal Society Te Apārangi","Funding.

PDAC is a notable malignancy that exhibits a discouraging prognosis and a rising occurrence. The interplay between diabetes and pancreatic cancer exhibits a reciprocal causation. The identified metabolic disorder has been observed to possess noteworthy consequences on health outcomes, resulting in elevated rates of morbidity. The principal mechanisms involve the suppression of the immune system, the activation of pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs), and the onset of systemic metabolic disease caused by dysfunction of the islets. From this point forward, it is important to recognize that pancreatic-cancer-related diabetes (PCRD) has the ability to increase the likelihood of developing pancreatic cancer. This highlights the complex relationship that exists between these two physiological states. Therefore, we investigated into the complex domain of PSCs, elucidating their intricate signaling pathways and the profound influence of chemokines on their behavior and final outcome. In order to surmount the obstacle of drug resistance and eliminate PDAC, researchers have undertaken extensive efforts to explore and cultivate novel natural compounds of the next generation. Additional investigation is necessary in order to comprehensively comprehend the effect of PCRD-mediated apoptosis on the progression and onset of PDAC through the utilization of natural compounds. This study aims to examine the potential anticancer properties of natural compounds in individuals with diabetes who are undergoing chemotherapy, targeted therapy, or immunotherapy. It is anticipated that these compounds will exhibit increased potency and possess enhanced pharmacological benefits. According to our research findings, it is indicated that naturally derived chemical compounds hold potential in the development of PDAC therapies that are both safe and efficacious. © 2023 by the author.","natural product; pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma; pancreatic stellate cells; pancreatic-cancer-related diabetes","Biological Products; Carcinoma, Pancreatic Ductal; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Humans; Pancreatic Carcinoma; Pancreatic Neoplasms; Pancreatic Stellate Cells; Tumor Microenvironment; antidiabetic agent; herbaceous agent; natural product; biological product; antineoplastic activity; cancer prognosis; cancer risk; cancer stem cell; cell activation; drug approval; Food and Drug Administration; herbal medicine; human; in vitro study; metabolic disorder; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonhuman; pancreatic ductal carcinoma; pancreatic stellate cell; Review; risk reduction; metabolism; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; pancreas carcinoma; pancreas tumor; pancreatic ductal carcinoma; tumor microenvironment","","Biological Products, ","","","Graduate School Innovation Office; Kyung Hee University, (KHU-20230914); Ministry of Education, MOE, (NRF-2020R1I1A2066868); Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP, (2020R1A5A2019413, 2022-IT-RD-0205-01-101); Ministry of Health and Welfare, MOHW, (HF20C0038); Korea Health Industry Development Institute, KHIDI; National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF","This research was supported by the Graduate School Innovation Office, Kyung Hee University, a grant from Kyung Hee University in 2023 (KHU-20230914); the Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education (NRF-2020R1I1A2066868); the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korean government (MSIT) (No. 2020R1A5A2019413); a grant of the Korea Health Technology R&D Project through the Korea Health Industry Development Institute (KHIDI), funded by the Ministry of Health and Welfare, Republic of Korea (grant number: HF20C0038); and the innovation network support program through the INNOPOLIS funded by Ministry of Science and ICT (2022-IT-RD-0205-01-101).","Quante A.S., Ming C., Rottmann M., Engel J., Boeck S., Heinemann V., Westphalen C.B., Strauch K., Projections of cancer incidence and cancer-related deaths in Germany by 2020 and 2030, Cancer Med, 5, pp. 2649-2656, (2016); Sung H., Ferlay J., Siegel R.L., Laversanne M., Soerjomataram I., Jemal A., Bray F., Global Cancer Statistics 2020: GLOBOCAN Estimates of Incidence and Mortality Worldwide for 36 Cancers in 185 Countries, CA Cancer J.

However, PaCDM and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) remain indistinguishable. We aim to address the differences between the pancreatic and gut endocrine hormones of patients with PaCDM and T2DM. Methods: A total of 44 participants underwent mixed meal tolerance test (MMTT). Fasting and postprandial concentrations of insulin, C-peptide, glucagon, pancreatic polypeptide (PP), glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), and gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP) were measured. Insulin sensitivity and secretion indices were calculated. One-way ANOVA with post-hoc analysis was used for statistical analysis. Results: Insulin and C-peptide responses to MMTT were blunted in PaCDM patients compared with T2DM. Baseline concentrations and AUCs differed. PaCDM patients showed lower insulin secretion capacity but better insulin sensitivity than T2DM patients. The peak concentration and AUC of PP in T2DM group were higher than healthy controls, but in accordance with PaCDM. PaCDM patients presented lower baseline GLP-1 concentration than T2DM patients. No between-group differences were found for glucagon and GIP. Conclusions: PaCDM patients had a lower baseline and postprandial insulin and C-peptide secretion than T2DM patients. Reduced insulin secretion and improved peripheral sensitivity were found in PaCDM patients compared with T2DM. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Pancreatic cancer; Pancreatic islet function; Pancreatogenic diabetes","Aged; Blood Glucose; C-Peptide; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Gastric Inhibitory Polypeptide; Glucagon; Glucagon-Like Peptide 1; Humans; Insulin; Insulin Resistance; Pancreatic Neoplasms; C peptide; gastric inhibitory polypeptide; glucagon; glucagon like peptide 1; insulin; pancreas polypeptide; C peptide; gastric inhibitory polypeptide; glucagon; glucagon like peptide 1; insulin; adult; aged; Article; B lymphocyte; cell function; cellular secretion; clinical article; clinical evaluation; clinical feature; cohort analysis; comparative study; controlled study; cross-sectional study; diabetes mellitus; disease association; female; human; insulin blood level; insulin release; insulin resistance; insulin sensitivity; male; middle aged; mixed meal tolerance test; pancreas cancer; prospective study; protein blood level; tolerance test; complication; glucose blood level; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; pancreas tumor","","C peptide, 59112-80-0; gastric inhibitory polypeptide, 59392-49-3; glucagon, 11140-85-5, 62340-29-8, 9007-92-5, 16941-32-5, 19179-82-9, 28270-04-4; glucagon like peptide 1, 89750-14-1; insulin, 9004-10-8; pancreas polypeptide, 59763-91-6; glucagon, 11140-85-5, 62340-29-8, 9007-92-5; Blood Glucose, ; C-Peptide, ; Gastric Inhibitory Polypeptide, ; Glucagon, ; Glucagon-Like Peptide 1, ; Insulin, ","","","Biobank; Zhongda Hospital; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (81570739, 81970717); Nanjing Medical University, NMU, (2242019K3DN07); Southeast University, SEU; Key Research and Development Program of Jiangxi Province, (BE2018742)","Funding text 1: The authors thank Biobank, Zhongda Hospital, Southeast University for technical assistance.

We aimed to examine the association of glycemic status and insulin resistance with pancreatic cancer mortality in individuals with and without diabetes.METHODS:This is a cohort study of 572,021 Korean adults without cancer at baseline, who participated in repeat screening examinations which included fasting blood glucose, hemoglobin A1c, and insulin, and were followed for a median of 8.4 years (interquartile range, 5.3 -13.2 years). Vital status and pancreatic cancer mortality were ascertained through linkage to national death records.RESULTS:During 5,211,294 person-years of follow-up, 260 deaths from pancreatic cancer were identified, with a mortality rate of 5.0 per 105person-years. In the overall population, the risk of pancreatic cancer mortality increased with increasing levels of glucose and hemoglobin A1c in a dose-response manner, and this association was observed even in individuals without diabetes. In nondiabetic individuals without previously diagnosed or screen-detected diabetes, insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia were positively associated with increased pancreatic cancer mortality. Specifically, the multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio (95% confidence intervals) for pancreatic cancer mortality comparing the homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance ≥75th percentile to the <75th percentile was 1.49 (1.08-2.05), and the corresponding hazard ratio comparing the insulin ≥75th percentile to the <75th percentile was 1.43 (1.05-1.95). These associations remained significant when introducing changes in insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, and other confounders during follow-up as time-varying covariates.DISCUSSION:Glycemic status, insulin resistance, and hyperinsulinemia, even in individuals without diabetes, were independently associated with an increased risk of pancreatic cancer mortality. © 2020 Wolters Kluwer Health.

Diabetics are at an increased risk for cancer. Previous studies have demonstrated improved outcomes in patients taking metformin suffering from prostate, colon, lung, thyroid, and esophageal cancers. Metformin's main antineoplastic mechanism of action is thought to be mediated through inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin, inhibition of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) alpha, and activation of p53. We investigated the overall survival of type 2 diabetic patients on metformin with pancreatic cancer and lymphoma using the Computerized Patient Record System at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Memphis TN. Methods: Lymphoma and pancreatic cancer patients with type 2 diabetes were sorted into an experimental (metformin) group and a control (nonmetformin) group. Patients were compared on baseline characteristics including race, body mass index, and age. Cancer outcomes including overall survival, metastasis, recurrences, and incidence of new malignancies were recorded. Hemoglobin A1C, creatinine and cancer treatment modalities were recorded and compared. Statistical analyses used included unpaired t tests and Chi-squared tests. Results: There was significantly greater overall long-term survival in the metformin group compared to the nonmetformin group for lymphoma (5.89 vs 1.29 years, P < 0.001) and for pancreatic cancer (0.68 vs 0.22 years, P = 0.016). Cancer treatment modalities in both groups were comparable. Conclusions: Metformin is associated with a significant, positive effect of increased overall survival in type 2 diabetes patients with pancreatic cancer and lymphoma. These results are encouraging, and prospective studies should be done to further investigate metformin's effects in cancer. © 2019 Southern Society for Clinical Investigation","Diabetes; Lymphoma; Metformin; Pancreatic cancer; Survival","Aged; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Female; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Lymphoma; Male; Metformin; Middle Aged; Pancreatic Neoplasms; creatinine; hemoglobin A1c; metformin; antidiabetic agent; metformin; adult; aged; Article; Black person; body mass; cancer recurrence; Caucasian; controlled study; disease association; female; human; long term survival; major clinical study; male; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; overall survival; pancreas cancer; population research; complication; lymphoma; middle aged; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; pancreas tumor","","creatinine, 19230-81-0, 60-27-5; hemoglobin A1c, 62572-11-6; metformin, 1115-70-4, 657-24-9; Hypoglycemic Agents, ; Metformin, ","","","National Institutes of Health, NIH; National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, NIDDK, (T35DK113964); Norges Idrettshøgskole, NIH","Conflict of interest and funding statement: There are no conflicts of interest.

Methods: This study retrospectively analysed the National Health Insurance database including patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus at an age ≥ 25 years between 1999 and 2010. A total of 71 137 ever users of sitagliptin and 933 046 never users were followed for pancreatic cancer until 31 December 2011. A time-dependent approach was used to calculate incidence and estimate hazard ratios adjusted for propensity score using Cox regression. Results: During follow-up, 83 ever users and 3658 never users developed pancreatic cancer, representing an incidence of 73·6 and 55·0 per 100 000 person-years, respectively. The adjusted hazard ratio (95% confidence intervals) for ever versus never users was 1·40 (1·13-1·75). The respective adjusted hazard ratio for the first, second and third tertile of cumulative dose < 14 700, 14 700-33 700 and > 33 700 mg was 1·83 (1·28-2·62), 1·97 (1·41-2·76) and 0·72 (0·45-1·15). For average daily dose of < 50, 50-99·9 and ≥ 100 mg, the respective hazard ratio was 3·10 (1·17-8·26), 1·01 (0·63-1·61) and 1·53 (1·18-1·97). Conclusions: Sitagliptin is significantly associated with a higher risk of pancreatic cancer, especially when the cumulative dose is < 33 700 mg. The risk diminished in users with a higher cumulative dose. The daily dose of sitagliptin should better be kept < 100 mg, and its use should be reconsidered in patients who suffer from severe renal impairment and thus a daily dose of < 50 mg is always recommended. Future studies are required to confirm the findings with more appropriate adjustment for smoking. © 2016 Stichting European Society for Clinical Investigation Journal Foundation.

Retinoids participate in multiple key processes in the human body e.g., vision, cell differentiation and embryonic development. There is growing evidence of the relationship between retinol, its active metabolite-all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) – and several pancreatic disorders. Although low levels of ATRA in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) tissue have been reported, data on serum levels of ATRA in PDAC is still limited. The aim of our work was to determine serum concentrations of retinol and ATRA in patients with PDAC, type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), chronic pancreatitis (CHP) and healthy controls. Methods. High performance liquid chromatography with UV detection (HPLC) was used to measure serum levels of retinol and ATRA in 246 patients with different stages of PDAC, T2DM, CHP and healthy controls. Results. We found a significant decrease in the retinol concentration in PDAC (0.44+/-0.18 mg/L) compared to T2DM (0.65+/-0.19 mg/L, P<0.001), CHP (0.60+/-0.18 mg/L, P< 0.001) and healthy controls (0.61+/-0.15 mg/L, P<0.001), significant decrease of ATRA levels in PDAC (1.14+/-0.49 ug/L) compared to T2DM (1.37+/-0.56 ug/L, P<0.001) and healthy controls(1.43+/-0.55 ug/L, P<0.001). Differences between early stages (I+II) of PDAC and non-carcinoma groups were not significant. We describe correlations between retinol, prealbumin and transferrin, and correlation of ATRA and IGFBP-2. Conclusion. Significant decrease in retinol and ATRA levels in PDAC compared to T2DM, healthy individuals and/or CHP supports existing evidence of the role of retinoids in PDAC. However, neither ATRA nor retinol are suitable for detection of early PDAC. Correlation of ATRA levels and IGFBP-2 provides new information about a possible IGF and retinol relationship. © 2024 The Authors.","all-trans-retinoic-acid; chronic pancreatitis; pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma;

The insulin/IGF signaling pathway related to insulin resistance, T2D and pancreatic cancer has been described. In this context, we have demonstrated the role of miRNAs in cancer progression and control of miRNAs in insulin/IGF signaling pathway, and pancreatic cancer. In this paper, an overview was depicted about the role of following miRNAs in pancreatic development and insulin secretion (miR-375, miR-7, miR-124a2, miR-195, miR-126, miR-9, miR-96, miR-34a); insulingrowth factor-1 receptor expression (miR-7, miR-139, miR-145, miR-1); the diabetes-associated pancreatic cancer pathway genes such as IRS, PI3K, AKT/PKB (miR-128a, miR-19a, miR-21, miR-29 a/b/c); mTOR protein regulation (miR- 99, miR-21, miR-126, and miR-146a) etc. At last, we have also explained the role of miRNAs in diagnostic marker (miR- 200, miR-21, miR-103, miR-107, and miR-155) and as a therapeutic modulator (miR-34, miR-21, miR-221, and miR-101) in pancreatic cancer. © 2013 Bentham Science Publishers.","Insulin resistance; Insulin/IGF-mTOR signaling pathway; miRNA; Pancreatic cancer; Type-2 diabetes","Animals; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; Insulin; Insulin Resistance; Insulin-Secreting Cells; MicroRNAs; Pancreas; Pancreatic Neoplasms; Receptor, IGF Type 1; RNA-Binding Proteins; Signal Transduction; TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases; adrenomedullin; microRNA; microRNA 1; microRNA 101; microrna 103; microRNA 107; microRNA 124a2; microRNA 126; microRNA 128a; microRNA 139; microRNA 145; microRNA 146a; microRNA 155; microRNA 195; microRNA 19a; microRNA 200; microRNA 21; microRNA 221; microRNA 29a; microRNA 29b; microrna 29c; microRNA 34; microRNA 34a; microRNA 375; microRNA 7; microRNA 9; microRNA 96; microRNA 99; somatomedin C receptor; unclassified drug; unindexed drug; article; cancer growth; colorectal cancer; disease course; epithelial mesenchymal transition; gene expression; glucose homeostasis; glucose metabolism; human; insulin release; insulin resistance; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonhuman; pancreas cancer; protein expression; signal transduction","","adrenomedullin, 148498-78-6; Insulin, ; MIRN195 microRNA, human, ; MIRN375 microRNA, human, ; MIRN7 microRNA, human, ; MTOR protein, human, 2.7.1.1; MicroRNAs, ; RNA-Binding Proteins, ; Receptor, IGF Type 1, 2.7.10.1; TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases, 2.7.1.1","","","","","Zimmet P., Globalization, coca-colonization and the chronic disease epidemic: Can the doomsday scenario be averted?, J Intern Med, 247, pp. 301-310, (2000); Zimmet P., Alberti K.G., Shaw J., Global and societal implications of the diabetes epidemic, Nature, 414, pp. 782-787, (2001); World Diabetes Population Hits 366 Million; King H., Aubert R.E., Herman W.H., Global burden of diabetes, 1995- 2025: Prevalence, numerical estimates, and projections, Diabetes Care, 21, pp. 1414-1431, (1998); Whiting D.R., Guariguata L., Weil C., Shaw J., IDF diabetes atlas: Global estimates of the prevalence of diabetes for 2011 and 2030, Diabetes Res Clin Pract, 94, pp. 311-321, (2011); Wild S., Roglic G., Green A., Sicree R., King H., Global prevalence of diabetes: Estimates for the year 2000 and projections for 2030, Diabetes Care, 27, pp. 1047-1053, (2004); Chakraborty C., Roy S.S., Hsu M.J., Agoramoorthy G., Landscape Mapping of Functional Proteins in Insulin Signal Transduction and Insulin Resistance: A Network-Based Protein-Protein Interaction Analysis, PLoS ONE, 6, 1, (2011); McCarthy M.I., Zeggini E., Genome-wide association studies in type 2 diabetes, Curr Diab Rep, 9, pp. 164-171, (2009); Weir G.C., Bonner-Weir S., Five stages of evolving beta-cell dysfunction during progression to diabetes, Diabetes, 53, (2004); Bonelli L., Aste H., Bovo P., Et al., Exocrine pancreatic cancer, cigarette smoking, and diabetes mellitus: A case-control study in northern Italy, Pancreas, 27, pp. 143-149, (2003); Frye J.N., Inder W.J., Dobbs B.R., Frizelle F.A., Pancreatic cancer and diabetes: Is there a relationship?

The selection of instrumental variables for T2DM was based on two genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analyses from European cohorts. Summary-level data for PaCa were extracted from the FinnGen and UK Biobank databases. Inverse variance weighted (IVW) and four other robust methods were employed in our MR analysis. Various sensitivity analyses and multivariable MR approaches were also performed to enhance the robustness of our findings. In the IVW and Mendelian Randomization Pleiotropy RESidual Sum and Outlier (MR-PRESSO) analyses, the odds ratios (ORs) for each 1-unit increase in genetically predicted log odds of T2DM were approximately 1.13 for PaCa. The sensitivity tests and multivariable MR supported the causal link between T2DM and PaCa without pleiotropic effects. Therefore, our analyses suggest a causal relationship between T2DM and PaCa, shedding light on the potential pathophysiological mechanisms of T2DM’s impact on PaCa. This finding underscores the importance of T2DM prevention as a strategy to reduce the risk of PaCa. © 2024 by the authors.","FinnGen; pancreatic cancer; two-sample Mendelian randomization; type 2 diabetes mellitus; UK Biobank","Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Odds Ratio; Pancreatic Neoplasms; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Risk Factors; Article; body mass; cancer risk; disease association; genome-wide association study; human; Mendelian randomization analysis; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; pancreas cancer; pathophysiology; pleiotropy; sensitivity analysis; waist circumference; genetic predisposition; genetics; genome-wide association study; Mendelian randomization analysis; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; odds ratio; pancreas tumor; risk factor; single nucleotide polymorphism","","","","","European Commission, EC, (101017441); European Commission, EC","The authors wish to acknowledge the participants and investigators of the FinnGen study and express their appreciation for the GWAS summary statistics provided by FinnGen.

In order to more deeply summarize the relationship between them, this article summarizes the epidemiological data on the relationship between PC and T2DM in the past 5 years, and further explains the mechanism of interaction between them. Meanwhile, it also summed up the effects of drug therapy for T2DMon PC and the impact of T2DMon surgical resection of PC. Epidemiological studies clearly indicate that the risk of PC is increased in patients with T2DM. But increasing epidemiological data points out that PC also acts as a cause of T2DM and newonset T2DM is sign and consequence of PC. Insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, hyperglycemia, and chronic inflammation are the mechanisms of T2DM-Associated PC. Metformin decreases the risk of PC, while insulin therapy increases the risk of PC. Besides, studies have shown that T2DM decreases the survival in patients with PC resection. © 2019 Li et al.","Bidirectional relationship; Pancreatic cancer; Type 2 diabetes","antineoplastic agent; insulin; metformin; oral antidiabetic agent; cancer adjuvant therapy; cancer risk; cancer survival; causal attribution; chronic inflammation; disease association; drug effect; hazard ratio; human; hyperglycemia; hyperinsulinemia; insulin resistance; insulin treatment; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; pancreas cancer; pancreaticoduodenectomy; Review; risk factor","","insulin, 9004-10-8; metformin, 1115-70-4, 657-24-9","","","","","Ryan D.P., Hong T.S., Bardeesy N., Pancreatic adenocarcinoma, N Engl J Med, 371, 11, pp. 1039-1049, (2014); Xiao A.Y., Tan M.L., Wu L.M., Et al., Global incidence and mortality of pancreatic diseases: A systematic review, meta-analysis, and metaregression of population-based cohort studies, Lancet Gastroenterol Hepatol, 1, 1, pp. 45-55, (2016); Siegel R.L., Miller K.D., Jemal A., Cancer statistics, 2018, CA Cancer J Clin, 68, 1, pp. 7-30, (2018); Maruthappu M., Watkins J., Noor A.M., Et al., Economic downturns, universal health coverage, and cancer mortality in high-income and middle-income countries, 1990-2010: A longitudinal analysis, Lancet, 388, pp. 684-695, (2016); Siegel R., Ma J., Zou Z., Jemal A., Cancer statistics, 2014, CA Cancer J Clin, 64, 1, pp. 9-29, (2014); Werner J., Combs S.E., Springfeld C., Hartwig W., Hackert T., Buchler M.W., Advanced-stage pancreatic cancer: Therapy options, Nat Rev Clin Oncol, 10, 6, pp. 323-333, (2013); Kamisawa T., Wood L.D., Itoi T., Takaori K., Pancreatic cancer, Lancet, 388, pp. 73-85, (2016); Konstantinidis I.T., Warshaw A.L., Allen J.N., Et al., Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma: Is there a survival difference for R1 resections versus locally advanced unresectable tumors?

The disease progression may be influenced by type 2 diabetes (T2D) and inflammatory status, although important gaps persist around their joint effects on disease outcome. The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical significance of the tumour immune microenvironment on pancreatic cancer prognosis in relation to T2D status. Method Tumour-infiltrating macrophages, neutrophils and eosinophils were studied in primary pancreatic tumours and paired lymph node metastases in relation to patient and tumour characteristics, T2D status and overall survival in a retrospective cohort of patients with resectable pancreatic cancer in Sweden. Results Of the 80 included pancreatic cancer patients, 22 (27.2%) had T2D. The diabetic pancreatic cancer patients had significantly higher systemic high white blood cell count than those without diabetes (P = 0.028). Macrophage infiltration levels were higher in lymph node metastases compared with primary tumours (P = 0.040) among pancreatic cancer patients with diabetes. Type 2 diabetes or intra-tumoural leukocyte (macrophage, neutrophil or eosinophil) infiltration alone did not significantly influence pancreatic cancer prognosis. However, among cancer patients with T2D high macrophage or neutrophil tumour-infiltration was associated with a significant reduction in overall survival (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 7.2; 95% CI 1.5–35.0 and HR 5.4; 95% CI 1.1–26.3, respectively). Conclusion These results demonstrate associations between T2D and enhanced inflammatory processes with significant implications on survival among pancreatic cancer patients with T2D. Validation in larger independent patient cohorts may identify additional prognostic tools and improved treatment strategies for specific patient subsets. © 2017 IAP and EPC","Macrophages; Neutrophils; Pancreatic cancer; Type 2 diabetes","Aged; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Disease Progression; Female; Humans; Leukocytes; Lymphatic Metastasis; Male; Middle Aged; Neutrophil Infiltration; Neutrophils; Pancreatic Neoplasms; Predictive Value of Tests; Tumor Microenvironment; aged; Article; cancer prognosis; eosinophil; female; human; human cell; leukocyte count; lymph node metastasis; macrophage; major clinical study; male; neutrophil; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; overall survival; pancreas cancer; patient selection; primary tumor; priority journal; Sweden; tumor associated leukocyte; tumor microenvironment; complication; disease exacerbation; leukocyte; middle aged; neutrophil chemotaxis; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; pancreas tumor; pathology; physiology; predictive value","","","","","Lund Hospital Fund; South Swedish Health Care Region; Region Skåne","The authors thank Britt-Marie Nilsson for assistance with immunohistochemical procedures and Håkan Lövkvist for assistance with statistical analyses.

This study aims to clarify such associations with new-onset type 2 diabetes and repeated measurements of glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels.Methods:A nested case-control study was initiated from the Health Improvement Network (THIN) in UK from 1996 to 2010. Information of pancreatic cancer cases was retrieved electronically from the medical records and manually validated. Control subjects were randomly selected and frequency-matched to the cases on sex, age, and calendar years. Multivariable unconditional logistic regression was performed to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI), and adjusted for potential confounders.Results:Among 1 574 768 person-years of follow-up, 529 pancreatic cancer cases and 5000 controls were identified. Type 2 diabetes, or changed HbA1c levels (rather than HbA1c levels at diabetes diagnosis) in diabetes patients (≥4 mmol mol -1 compared with <0 mmol mol -1) were followed by an increased OR of pancreatic cancer (OR, 2.16, 95% CI 1.72-2.72 and OR, 5.06, 95% CI 1.52-16.87, respectively). Among the anti-diabetic medications in diabetes patients, the OR for insulin users was 25.57 (95% CI 11.55-56.60), sulphonylureas 2.22 (95% CI 1.13, 4.40), and metformin users 1.46 (95% CI 0.85-2.52), compared with no use of any anti-diabetic medications.Conclusions:New-onset type 2 diabetes and, particularly, diabetes with rising HbA1c seem to be independent risk factors for pancreatic cancer. The relation between different anti-diabetic medications and pancreatic cancer seems to vary in strength, with the highest risk among users of insulin. © 2015 Cancer Research UK.","anti-diabetic medications;

However, there is a concern that DPP-4i may adversely impact the exocrine pancreas, owing to their pleiotropic effects. In this study, we investigated whether DPP-4i are associated with pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer using a nationwide population-based cohort study. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Weincluded patients newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes who were treated with antidiabetes drugs (n = 33,208) from 2007 to 2013. The data were obtained from the Korean National Health Insurance Service-Health Screening Cohort database (n = 514,866). Risk was estimated using a Cox proportional hazards model with timedependent covariates.A6-month lag timewasused to account for a possible latency time. The risk across various time segments since the first prescription of DPP-4i was also analyzed. RESULTS Out of 33,208 subjects, 10,218 were new users of DPP-4i and 22,990 were new users of other antidiabetes drugs. DPP-4i significantly increased the risks of pancreatitis (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.24,95%CI 1.01-1.52; P = 0.037) and pancreatic cancer (aHR 1.81,95%CI 1.16-2.82;P=0.009) with a 6-month drug use lag period. The risk of pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer was generally consistent in the first 12 months and 1 year after the initial prescription without showing an increasing trend according to exposure duration. CONCLUSIONS DPP-4i use is associated with increased risks of pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes. However, the absence of increasing trend according to exposure duration suggests the chances of reverse causality, and long-term pancreatic safety of DPP-4i has to be further investigated. © 2019 by the American Diabetes Association.","","Aged; Cohort Studies; Databases, Factual; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Dipeptidyl-Peptidase IV Inhibitors; Female; Humans; Incretins; Male; Middle Aged; Pancreatic Neoplasms; Pancreatitis; Proportional Hazards Models; Risk Factors; dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor; dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor; incretin; adult; adverse outcome; Article; cancer risk; cohort analysis; drug effect; drug efficacy; drug exposure; drug response; drug safety; drug use; female; follow up; human; incidence; major clinical study; male; middle aged; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; pancreas cancer; pancreatitis; population research; risk factor; treatment duration; trend study; aged; factual database; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; pancreas tumor; pancreatitis; proportional hazards model","","Dipeptidyl-Peptidase IV Inhibitors, ; Incretins, ","","","Bio & Medical Technology Development Program of the National Research Foundation; Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP, (2016R1A2B4013029); Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP; Yonsei University College of Medicine, YUCM, (6-2017-0053); Yonsei University College of Medicine, YUCM","Acknowledgments.

One of the features of pancreatic cancer (PC) metabolic reprogramming is the crosstalk between PC and peripheral tissues (skeletal muscle and adipose tissues), emphasized by insulin resistance (IR). Our previous study reported that mice pancreatic cancer-derived exosomes could induce skeletal muscle cells (C2C12) IR, and exosomal microRNAs (miRNAs) may exert an important effect. However, the underlying mechanism remains to be further elucidated. Methods: qPCR was used to determine the expression of let-7b-5p in normal pancreatic islet cells and PC cells. Exosomes were purified from PC cell culture medium by ultracentrifugation. The role let-7b-5p on IR-mediated by PC cells-derived exosomes was asses by Oil Red O staining using miRNA inhibitor. Western blot assay was performed to examine the expression of IR-related genes and the activation of signaling pathways. A Luciferase experiment was applied to confirm how let-7b-5p regulated the expression of RNF20. IP/WB analysis further determined whether RNF20 promoted STAT3 ubiquitination. Rescue experiment using RNF20 overexpression plasmid was performed to confirm the role of RNF20 on IR-mediated using PC cell-derived exosomes in C2C12 myotube cells. Results: miRNA-let-7b-5p was identified as the key exosomal miRNA, which could promote the IR in C2C12 myotube cells supported the lipid accumulation, the activation of STAT3/FOXO1 axis, and the decreased expression of IRS-1 and GLUT4. RNF20, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, was confirmed as the target gene of let-7b-5p and was found to improve IR by downregulating STAT3 protein expression via ubiquitination-mediated protein degradation. The ectopic expression of RNF20 could effectively attenuate the IR mediated by the pancreatic cancer-derived exosomes in C2C12 myotube cells. Conclusion: Our data suggest that exosomal miRNA-let-7b-5p may promote IR in C2C12 myotube cells by targeting RNF20 to activate the STAT3/FOXO1 axis. © 2023 Wang et al.

With the increasing incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), it is particularly important to clarify the relationship between T2DM and pancreatic cancer. The insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system plays an important role in the carcinogenesis and progression of pancreatic cancer caused by T2DM. In this review, we mainly summarize the recent research progress on the role of IGF in pancreatic cancer caused by T2DM and aim to explain that T2DM may increase the incidence of pancreatic cancer through the IGF system, to further provide a basis for clinical treatment of T2DM and concurrent pancreatic cancer. © Science Printers and Publishers, Inc.","hyperglycemia;

Methods: From January 2008 to August 2013, 171 patients with pancreatic cancer and new-onset diabetes were recruited for the study; 242 age-And gender-matched patients with common type 2 diabetes were also identified as control during the same period. The patient's characteristics and laboratory parameters were compared between the 2 groups. Results: By multivariate logistic regression analysis, we found that body mass index (BMI), the age of onset of diabetes, hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, total bilirubin (TBIL), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), creatinine (Cr), apolipoprotein-A1 (APO-A1), and white blood cell (WBC) were independent predictive factors for differentiating PC + DM from common type 2 diabetes; the areas under receiver operating characteristic curves were up to 0.815 for the combination of these 8 markers. Conclusions: These results suggest that BMI, the age of onset of diabetes, HBV infection, TBIL, ALT, Cr, APO-A1, and WBC are factors that could differentiate PC + DM from common type 2-diabetes and may be used for early diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. © 2018 S.

Carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) based approaches differentiate less than 60% of cases of pancreatic cancer (PC) from those of pancreatic tissue damage caused by chronic pancreatitis and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). This study aims to identify potential blood-derived candidate biomarkers for improved diagnosis sensitivity. Methods. Plasma metabolic profiles in 26 PC patients, 27 DM patients, and 23 healthy volunteers were examined using an ultraperformance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry platform. Differential metabolite ions were then identified using the principal component analysis (PCA) model and the orthogonal partial least-squares discrimination analysis (OPLS-DA) model. The diagnosis performance of metabolite biomarkers was validated by logistic regression models. Results. We established a PCA model (R2X = 23.5%, Q2 = 8.21%) and an OPLS-DA model (R2X = 70.0%, R2Y = 84.9%, Q2 = 69.7%). LysoPC (16: 0), catelaidic acid, cerebronic acid, nonadecanetriol, and asparaginyl-histidine were found to identify PC, with a sensitivity of 89% and a specificity of 91%. Besides, lysoPC (16: 0), lysoPC (16: 1), lysoPC (22: 6), and lysoPC (20: 3) were found to differentiate PC from DM, with higher accuracy (68% versus 55%) and higher AUC values (72% versus 63%) than those of CA19-9. The diagnostic performance of metabolite biomarkers was finally validated by logistic regression models. Conclusion. We succeeded in screening differential metabolite ions among PC and DM patients and healthy individuals, thus providing a preliminary basis for screening the biomarkers for the early diagnosis of PC.  © 2021 Hongmin Xu et al.","","amino acid; asparaginylhistidine; biological marker; catelaidic acid; cerebronic acid; nonadecanetriol; unclassified drug; very long chain fatty acid; adult; area under the curve; Article; blood analysis; controlled study; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic value; differential diagnosis; early diagnosis; female; human; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; logistic regression analysis; major clinical study; male; metabolomics; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; orthogonal partial least square discrimination analysis; pancreas cancer; partial least squares regression; principal component analysis; screening test; sensitivity and specificity; validation process","","amino acid, 65072-01-7","","","","","Fukutake N., Ueno M., Hiraoka N., Shimada K., Shiraishi K., Saruki N., Ito T., Yamakado M., Ono N., Imaizumi A., Kikuchi S., Yamamoto H., Katayama K., A novel multivariate index for pancreatic cancer detection based on the plasma free amino acid profile, PLoS One, 10, 7, (2005); Potjer T.P., Schot I., Langer P., Heverhagen J.T., Wasser M.N.J.M., Slater E.P., Kloppel G., Morreau H.M., Bonsing B.A., De Vos Tot Nederveen Cappel W.H., Bargello M., Gress T.M., Vasen H.F.A., Bartsch D.K., Variation in precursor lesions of pancreatic cancer among high-risk groups, Clinical Cancer Research, 19, 2, pp. 442-449, (2013); Rahib L., Smith B.D., Aizenberg R., Rosenzweig A.B., Fleshman J.M., Matrisian L.M., Projecting cancer incidence and deaths to 2030: The unexpected burden of thyroid, liver, and pancreas cancers in the United States, Cancer Research, 74, 11, pp. 2913-2921, (2014); Duell E.J., Lucenteforte E., Olson S.H., Bracci P.M., Li D., Risch H.A., Silverman D.T., Ji B.T., Gallinger S., Holly E.A., Fontham E.H., Maisonneuve P., Bueno-De-Mesquita H.B., Ghadirian P., Kurtz R.C., Ludwig E., Yu H., Lowenfels A.B., Seminara D., Petersen G.M., La Vecchia C., Boffetta P., Pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer risk: A pooled analysis in the international pancreatic cancer case-control consortium (PanC4), Annals of Oncology, 23, 11, pp. 2964-2970, (2012); Kamisawa T., Wood L.D., Itoi T., Takaori K., Pancreatic cancer, The Lancet, 388, 10039, pp. 73-85, (2016); Jiao L., Maity S., Coarfa C., Rajapakshe K., Chen L., Jin F., Putluri V., Tinker L.F., Mo Q., Chen F., Sen S., Sangi-Hyghpeykar H., El-Serag H.B., Putluri N., A prospective targeted serum metabolomics study of pancreatic cancer in postmenopausal women, Cancer Prevention Research, 12, 4, pp. 237-246, (2019); Ballehaninna U.K., Chamberlain R.S., Serum CA 19-9 as a biomarker for pancreatic cancer-A comprehensive review, Indian Journal of Surgical Oncology, 2, 2, pp. 88-100, (2011); Mayerle J., Kalthoff H., Reszka R., Kamlage B., Peter E., Schniewind B., Gonzalez Maldonado S., Pilarsky C., Heidecke C.-D., Schatz P., Distler M., Scheiber J.A., Mahajan U.M., Weiss F.U., Grutzmann R., Lerch M.M., Metabolic biomarker signature to differentiate pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma from chronic pancreatitis, Gut, 67, 1, pp. 128-137, (2018); De Icaza E., Lopez-Cervantes M., Arredondo A., Robles-Diaz G., Likelihood ratios of clinical, laboratory and image data of pancreatic cancer: Bayesian approach, Journal of Evaluation in Clinical Practice, 15, 1, pp. 62-68, (2009); Uygur-Bayramicli O., Dabak R., Orbay E., Dolapcioglu C., Sargin M., Type 2 diabetes mellitus and CA 19-9 levels, World Journal of Gastroenterology, 13, 40, pp. 5357-5359, (2007); Malka D., Hammel P., Sauvanet A., Rufat P., O'Toole D., Bardet P., Belghiti J., Bernades P., Ruszniewski P., Levy P., Risk factors for diabetes mellitus in chronic pancreatitis, Gastroenterology, 119, 5, pp. 1324-1332, (2000); Levy P., Milan C., Pignon J.P., Baetz A., Bernades P., Mortality factors associated with chronic pancreatitis.

Several studies have suggested a role for diabetes mellitus, but the magnitude of its contribution remains controversial. Objectives: Utilizing a large administrative database, this retrospective cohort study was designed to investigate the relationship between type 2 diabetes mellitus and pancreatic cancer. Patients and design: Using the Veterans Integrated Services Network 16 database, 322,614 subjects were enrolled in the study, including 110,919 with type 2 diabetes mellitus and 211,695 diabetes-free controls matched by gender, year of birth and healthcare facility. Results: A significantly higher incidence of pancreatic cancer was observed in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, with an adjusted hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) of 2.17 (1.70-2.77) for type 2 diabetes mellitus compared to controls (p < 10-9) after controlling for the matching factors. Conclusion: The association between type 2 diabetes mellitus and pancreatic cancer was statistically significant and may, in part, explain the rising incidence of pancreatic cancer. © The Author(s) 2016.","Hyperinsulinemia;

This study was aimed to investigate the shared gene signatures and molecular processes between PC and T2DM. Methods: The Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database was used to retrieve the RNA sequence and patient information of PC and T2DM. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was performed to discover a co-expression network associated with PC and T2DM. Enrichment analysis of shared genes present in PC and T2DM was performed by ClueGO software. These results were validated in the other four cohorts based on differential gene analysis. The predictive significance of S100A6 in PC was evaluated using univariate and multivariate Cox analyses, as well as Kaplan–Meier plots. The biological process of S100A6 enrichment in PC was detected using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). The involvement of S100A6 in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) was assessed by CIBERSORT. In vitro assays were used to further confirm the function of S100A6 in PC. Results: WGCNA recognized three major modules for T2DM and two major modules for PC. There were 44 shared genes identified for PC and T2DM, and Gene Ontology (GO) analysis showed that regulation of endodermal cell fate specification was primarily enriched. In addition, a key shared gene S100A6 was derived in the validation tests. S100A6 was shown to be highly expressed in PC compared to non-tumor tissues. PC patients with high S100A6 expression had worse overall survival (OS) than those with low expression. GSEA revealed that S100A6 is involved in cancer-related pathways and glycometabolism-related pathways. There is a strong relationship between S100A6 and TIME. In vitro functional assays showed that S100A6 helped to induce the PC cells’ proliferation and migration. We also proposed a diagram of common mechanisms of PC and T2DM. Conclusions: This study firstly revealed that the regulation of endodermal cell fate specification may be common pathogenesis of PC and T2DM and identified S100A6 as a possible biomarker and therapeutic target for PC and T2DM patients.

Objective: To investigate whether prediagnostic fasting glucose and insulin concentrations and insulin resistance are associated with subsequent incidence of exocrine pancreatic cancer in a cohort of male smokers. Design, Setting, and Participants: A case-cohort prospective study within the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention Study (1985-1988) cohort of 29 133 male Finnish smokers ages 50 to 69 years. The study included 400 randomly sampled subcohort control participants and 169 incident pancreatic cancer cases that occurred after the fifth year of follow-up. All participants were followed up through December 2001 (up to 16.7 years of follow-up). Main Outcome Measures: Incident exocrine pancreatic cancer identified from the Finnish Cancer Registry. Results: After adjusting for age, smoking, and body mass index, higher baseline fasting serum concentrations of glucose, insulin, and insulin resistance were positively associated with pancreatic cancer. The presence of biochemically defined diabetes mellitus (glucose, ≥126 mg/dL [≥6.99 mmol/L]) and insulin concentration in the highest vs lowest quartile both showed a significant 2-fold increased risk (hazard ratio [HR], 2.13; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04-4.35; and HR, 2.01; 95% CI, 1.03-3.93; respectively). There were significant interactions for all the biomarker exposures by follow-up time, such that the positive associations were stronger among the cases that occurred more than 10 years after baseline (highest vs lowest quartile: glucose, HR, 2.16; 95% CI, 1.05-4.42; P for trend=.02; insulin, HR, 2.90; 95% CI, 1.22-6.92; P for trend=.005; and insulin resistance, HR, 2.71; 95% CI, 1.19-6.18; P for trend=.006). Conclusions: These results support the hypothesis that exposure to higher insulin concentrations and insulin resistance predicts the risk of exocrine pancreatic cancer. ©2005 American Medical Association.

Type-II diabetes is widely considered to be associated with pancreatic cancer, but whether this represents a causal or consequential association is unclear. We conducted a meta-analysis to examine this association. A computer-based literature search from 1966 to 2005 yielded 17 case-control and 19 cohort or nested case-control studies with information on 9220 individuals with pancreatic cancer. The age and sex-adjusted odds ratio (OR) for pancreatic cancer associated with type-II diabetes was obtained from each study. The combined summary odds ratio was 1.82 (95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.66-1.89), with evidence of heterogeneity across the studies (P = 0.002 for case-control and P = 0.05 for cohort studies) that was explained, in part, by higher risks being reported by smaller studies and studies that reported before 2000. Individuals in whom diabetes had only recently been diagnosed (<4 years) had a 50% greater risk of the malignancy compared with individuals who had diabetes for ≥5 years (OR 2.1 vs 1.5; P = 0.005), These results support a modest causal association between type-II diabetes and pancreatic cancer. © 2005 Cancer Research UK.","Meta-analysis; Pancreatic cancer; Type-II diabetes","Case-Control Studies; Cohort Studies; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Humans; Odds Ratio; Pancreatic Neoplasms; Risk Factors; Time Factors; article; cancer epidemiology; cancer mortality; cancer risk; case control study; cohort analysis; disease association; disease duration; human; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; meta analysis; nested case control study; pancreas cancer; priority journal","","","","","","","Adami H.-O., McLaughlin J., Ekbom A., Cancer risk in patients with diabetes mellitus, Cancer Causes Control, 2, pp. 307-314, (1994); Anderson K.E., Johnson T.W., Lazovich D., Folsom A.R., Association between nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use and the incidence of pancreatic cancer, J Nat Cancer Inst, 94, pp. 1168-1171, (2002); Baghurst P.A., McMichael A.J., Slavotinek A.H., Baghurst K.I., Boyle P., Walker A.M., A case-control study of diet and cancer of the pancreas, Am J Epidemiol, 134, pp. 167-179, (1991); Balkau B., Barrett-Connor E., Eschwege E., Richard J.-L., Claude J.-R., Ducimetiere P., Diabetes and pancreatic cancer, Diab Metab, 19, pp. 458-462, (1993); Batty G.D., Shipley M.J., Marmot M., Smith G.D., Diabetes status and post-load plasma glucose concentration in relation to site-specific cancer mortality: Findings from the original Whitehall study, Cancer Causes Control, 15, pp. 873-881, (2004); Berrington De Gonzalez A., Sweetland S., Spencer E., A meta-analysis of obesity and the risk of pancreatic cancer, Br J Cancer, 89, pp. 519-523, (2003); Bonelli L., Aste H., Bovo P., Cavallini G., Felder M., Gusmaroli R., Morandini E., Ravelli P., Briglia R., Lombardo L., De Micheli A., Pugliese V., Exocrine pancreatic cancer, cigarette smoking, and diabetes mellitus: A case-control study in northern Italy, Pancreas, 27, pp. 143-149, (2003); Bueno De Mesquita H.B., Maisonneuve P., Moerman C.J., Walker A.M., Aspects of medical history and exocrine carcinoma of the pancreas: A population-based case-control study in the Netherlands, Int J Cancer, 52, pp. 17-23, (1992); Calle E.E., Murphy T.K., Rodriguez C., Thun M.J., Heath W.C., Diabetes mellitus and pancreatic cancer mortality in a prospective cohort of US adults, Canc Causes Contr, 9, pp. 403-410, (1998); Chow W.H., Gridley G., Nyren O., Linet M.S., Ekbom A., Fraumeni Jr. J.F., Adami H.O., Risk of pancreatic cancer following diabetes mellitus: A nationwide cohort study in Sweden, J Nat Canc Inst, 87, pp. 930-931, (1995); Coughlin S.S., Calle E.E., Patel A.V., Thun M.J., Predictors of pancreatic cancer mortality among a large cohort of United States adults, Cancer Causes Control, 11, pp. 915-923, (2000); Coughlin S.S., Calle E.E., Teras L.R., Petrelli J., Thun M.J., Diabetes mellitus as a predictor of cancer mortality in a large cohort of US adults, Am J Epidemiol, 159, pp. 1160-1167, (2004); Cull C.A., Neil H.A., Holman R.R., Changing aspirin use in patients with Type 2 diabetes in the UKPDS, Diab Med, 21, pp. 1368-1371, (2004); Cuzick J., Babiker A.G., Pancreatic cancer, alcohol, diabetes mellitus and gall-bladder disease, Int J Cancer, 43, pp. 415-421, (1989); Davey Smith G., Bracha Y., Svendsen K.H., Neaton J.D., Haffner S.M., Kuller L.H., Incidence of type 2 diabetes in the randomized multiple risk factor intervention trial, Ann Intern Med, 142, pp. 313-322, (2005); Davey Smith G., Egger M., Shipley M.J., Marmot M.G., Post-challenge glucose concentration, impaired glucose tolerance, diabetes and cancer mortality in men, Am J Epidemiol, 136, pp. 1110-1114, (1992); Doll R., Peto R., Mortality in relation to smoking: 20 years observation on male British doctors, Br Med J, 2, pp. 1525-1536, (1976); Ekoe J.M., Ghadirian P., Simard A., Baillargeon J., Perret C., Diabete sucre et cancer du pancreas: Une etude cas-temoins dans le grand Montreal, Quebec, Canada, Rev Epidemiol Sante Publ, 40, pp. 447-453, (1992); Everhart J., Wright D., Diabetes mellitus as a risk factor for pancreatic cancer: A meta-analysis, JAMA, 273, pp. 1605-1609, (1995); Farrow D.C., Davis S., Risk of pancreatic cancer in relation to medical history and the use of tobacco, alcohol and coffee, Int J Cancer, 45, pp. 816-820, (1990); Friedman G.D., Van Den Eeden S.K., Risk factors for pancreatic cancer: An exploratory study, Int J Epidemiol, 22, pp. 30-37, (1993); Frye J.N., Inder W.J., Dobbs B.R., Frizelle F.A., Pancreatic cancer and diabetes: Is there a relationship?

Objective: To investigate the association of GLP-1RA treatment with pancreatic cancer incidence over 9 years of follow-up. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this population-based historical cohort study, adult patients (aged 21 to 89 years) with type 2 diabetes insured by Clalit Healthcare Services, the largest state-mandated health organization in Israel, were followed up from 2009, when GLP-1RA became available in Israel, until pancreatic cancer diagnosis, death, reaching age 90 years, or end of follow-up (December 2017). Data were analyzed from June 2022 to November 2023. Exposures: Treatment with GLP-1RA was compared with basal insulin. Main Outcome and Measures: Pancreatic cancer incidence was compared according to weighted cumulative exposures to GLP-1RA and to basal insulin in a Cox model implemented in discrete time, with time origin at 2 years after diabetes diagnosis, adjusting for confounding. In sensitivity analyses, propensity score-matched pair new-user design and prevalent new-user design were used for the comparison. Because of risk for reverse-causation bias, results in the fifth to seventh year after medication were emphasized. Results: During a cumulative follow-up of 3290439 person-years of 543595 adults with a mean (SD) age of 59.9 (12.8) years (277502 women [51%]) with incident diabetes, 1665 patients received pancreatic cancer diagnoses. In total, 33377 patients (6.1%) used GLP-1RA and 106849 (19.7%) used basal insulin. The estimated hazard ratio (HR) for pancreatic cancer associated with incremental use of 1 defined daily dose per day of GLP-1RA compared with basal insulin in the fifth to seventh year previously (all other characteristics, including age, sex, ethnic background, sociodemographic status, baseline body mass index, smoking history, history of pancreatitis, other glucose-lowering medications treatment history, and length of diabetes, being equal) was 0.50 (95% CI, 0.15-1.71). The new-user and prevalent new-user designs showed HRs from the fifth year onwards following initiation of GLP-1RA vs basal insulin of 0.52 (95 % CI, 0.19-1.41) and 0.75 (95 % CI, 0.37-1.53), respectively. Conclusions and Relevance: In this historical cohort study of adults with type 2 diabetes, no support for an increased pancreatic cancer incidence over 7 years following start of GLP-1RA treatment was found. However, monitoring for pancreatic cancer risk beyond 7 years following initiation of therapy is still required.

The intracellular mechanism of this insulin resistance was investigated in skeletal muscle biopsies from pancreatic cancer patients with or without diabetes and control subjects. Insulin receptor (IR) binding, tyrosine kinase activity, IR messenger RNA (mRNA), IR substrate-1 content, GLUT-4, and GLUT-4 mRNA content were all normal in pancreatic cancer patients. In contrast, multiple defects in glycogen synthesis were found in pancreatic cancer patients, especially in those with diabetes. Glycogen synthase I activity, total activity, and mRNA levels were significantly decreased in pancreatic cancer patients compared with controls. The fractional velocity of glycogen synthase was decreased only in the diabetic pancreatic cancer group. Glycogen phosphorylase a and b activities were increased in diabetic pancreatic cancer patients, but glycogen phosphorylase mRNA levels were not significantly different. The insulin resistance associated with pancreatic cancer is associated with a post-IR defect, which impairs skeletal muscle glycogen synthesis and glycogen storage.","","Blotting, Western; Diabetes Mellitus; Female; Fungal Proteins; Glucose Transporter Type 4; Glycogen Synthase; Humans; Insulin Resistance; Male; Middle Aged; Monosaccharide Transport Proteins; Muscle Proteins; Muscle, Skeletal; Pancreatic Neoplasms; Phosphorylases; Protein-Tyrosine Kinases; Receptor, Insulin; Repressor Proteins; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; RNA, Messenger; Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins; glucose transporter; glycogen; glycogen phosphorylase; glycogen phosphorylase b; glycogen synthase; insulin; insulin receptor; messenger RNA; protein tyrosine kinase; adult; article; clinical article; controlled study; diabetes mellitus; enzyme activity; female; glycogen metabolism; glycogen synthesis; human; human tissue; insulin resistance; male; muscle biopsy; pancreas cancer; priority journal; receptor binding","","Fungal Proteins, ; Glucose Transporter Type 4, ; Glycogen Synthase, EC 2.4.1.11; IRA1 protein, S cerevisiae, ; Monosaccharide Transport Proteins, ; Muscle Proteins, ; Phosphorylases, EC 2.4.1.-; Protein-Tyrosine Kinases, EC 2.7.1.112; Receptor, Insulin, EC 2.7.1.112; Repressor Proteins, ; RNA, Messenger, ; Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins, ; SLC2A4 protein, human, ","","","","","Permert J., Ihse I., Jorfeldt L., Von Schench H., Arnqvist H.J., Larsson J., Pancreatic cancer is associated with impaired glucose metabolism, Eur J Surg, 159, pp. 101-107, (1993); Schwartz S.S., Zeidler A., Moossa A.R., Kuku S.F., Rubenstein A.H., A prospective study of glucose tolerance, insulin, C-peptide, and glucagon responses in patients with pancreatic carcinoma, Am J Dig Dis, 23, pp. 1107-1114, (1978); Adami H.O., McLaughlin S., Ekban A., Cancer risk in patients with diabetes mellitus, Cancer Causes Control, 2, pp. 307-314, (1991); Gullo L., Pezzilli R., Morselli-Labate A., Diabetes and the risk of pancreatic cancer, N Engl J Med, 79, pp. 1223-1231, (1994); Vecchis C.L., Negri E., Franceschi S., D'Avanzo B., Boyle P., Diabetes and pancreatic cancer risk, Int J Pancretol, 16, pp. 81-84, (1994); Permert J., Adrian T.E., Jacobsson P., Jorfelt L., Fruin B., Larsson J., Is profound peripheral insulin resistance in patients with pancreatic cancer caused by tumor-associated factor?, Am J Surg, 165, pp. 61-67, (1993); Gullo L., Anocna D., Pezzilll R., Casadei R., Campione O., Glucose tolerance and insulin secretion in pancreatic cancer, Ital J Gastroenterol, 25, pp. 487-489, (1993); Fogar P., Basso D., Panozzo M.P., Et al., C-peptide pattern in patients with pancreatic cancer, Anticancer Res, 13, pp. 2577-2580, (1993); Cersosimo E., Pisters P., Pesola G., McDermott K., Bajorunas D., Brennan M.F., Insulin secretion and action in patients with pancreatic cancer, Cancer, 67, pp. 468-493, (1991); Pennert J., Ihse I., Jorfeldt L., Von-Schenck H., Arnquist H.J., Larsson J., Improved glucose metabolism after subtotal pancreatectomy for pancreatic cancer, Br J Surg, 80, pp. 1047-1050, (1993); DeFronzo R.A., The triumvirate: β-cell, muscle, liver.

Methods: This retrospective cohort study included patients diagnosed with stage I/II PC at Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University from January 2012 to December 2017. All patients had pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma or its subtypes. The outcome was the 5-year OS rate based on data from the patient charts. Data analysis was performed using SPSS 22.0 Results: A total of 238 patients were included: 72 with T2DM and 166 without T2DM. There were significant differences in blood glucose levels and OS between the two groups (all P < 0.05). The median OS was 11.4 (95% confidence interval CI [8.49–14.31]) months in the T2DM group and 16.3 (95% CI [12.44–20.16], P = 0.023) months in the non-T2DM group. After adjustment for confounders, T2DM was an independent factor affecting 5-year OS (P = 0.010). Compared with non-T2DM patients, T2DM patients had a higher risk of death (HR = 1.475, 95% CI [1.096–1.985]). Conclusions: T2DM is associated with 5-year OS in patients with PC. © Copyright 2022 Tang et al.","Asian continental ancestry group; Diabetes mellitus; Glycemic control; Pancreatic cancer; Survival analysis","CA 19-9 antigen; adult; ancestry group; Article; blood pressure; body mass; cancer staging; clinical outcome; cohort analysis; controlled study; data analysis; diabetes mellitus; female; glucose blood level; glycemic control; human; hypertension; lymph node metastasis; major clinical study; male; middle aged; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; overall survival; pancreas cancer; pancreatectomy; pancreaticoduodenectomy; pathogenesis; retrospective study; smoking; survival analysis; survival rate; tumor differentiation","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (81773108)","The following grant information was disclosed by the authors: National Natural Science Foundation of China: 81773108.","Allemani C, Matsuda T, Di Carlo V, Harewood R, Matz M, Niksic M, Bonaventure A, Valkov M, Johnson CJ, Esteve J, Ogunbiyi OJ, Azevedo ESG, Chen WQ, Eser S, Engholm G, Stiller CA, Monnereau A, Woods RR, Visser O, Lim GH, Aitken J, Weir HK, Coleman MP., Global surveillance of trends in cancer survival 2000-14 (CONCORD-3): analysis of individual records for 3,75,13,025 patients diagnosed with one of 18 cancers from 322 population-based registries in 71 countries, Lancet, 391, pp. 1023-1075, (2018); Alpertunga I, Sadiq R, Pandya D, Lo T, Dulgher M, Evans S, Bennett B, Rennert N, Frank RC., Glycemic control as an early prognostic marker in advanced pancreatic cancer, Frontiers in Oncology, 11, (2021); Standards of medical care in diabetes–2009, Diabetes Care, 32, pp. S13-S61, (2009); Andersen DK, Korc M, Petersen GM, Eibl G, Li D, Rickels MR, Chari ST, Abbruzzese JL., Diabetes, pancreatogenic diabetes, and pancreatic cancer, Diabetes, 66, 5, pp. 1103-1110, (2017); Arnold M, Rutherford MJ, Bardot A, Ferlay J, Andersson TM, Myklebust T, Tervonen H, Thursfield V, Ransom D, Shack L, Woods RR, Turner D, Leonfellner S, Ryan S, Saint-Jacques N, De P, McClure C, Ramanakumar AV, Stuart-Panko H, Engholm G, Walsh PM, Jackson C, Vernon S, Morgan E, Gavin A, Morrison DS, Huws DW, Porter G, Butler J, Bryant H, Currow DC, Hiom S, Parkin DM, Sasieni P, Lambert PC, Moller B, Soerjomataram I, Bray F., Progress in cancer survival, mortality, and incidence in seven high-income countries 1995–2014 (ICBP SURVMARK-2): a population-based study, Lancet Oncology, 20, 11, pp. 1493-1505, (2019); Balzano G, Dugnani E, Gandolfi A, Scavini M, Pasquale V, Aleotti F, Liberati D, Di Terlizzi G, Petrella G, Reni M, Doglioni C, Bosi E, Falconi M, Piemonti L., Effect of diabetes on survival after resection of pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

Objective: The present study aims to examine the predictors for PaC in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in a territory-wide, retrospective cohort study. Methods: This was a territory-wide, retrospective cohort study of patients with T2DM mellitus older than 40 years with no prior history of PaC. Baseline demographics, use of antidiabetic medications, comorbidities, and biochemical parameters were extracted. Cox regression was used to calculate hazard ratios (HR) with 95% CI. Subgroup analyses based on chronic kidney disease (CKD) stages were performed. Results: This study consisted of 273 738 patients (age = 65.4 ± 12.7 years, male = 48.2%, follow-up duration = 3547 ± 1207 days, disease duration = 4.8 ± 2.3 years), of whom 1148 developed PaC. The number of antidiabetic medications prescribed (HR: 1.20; 95% CI, 1.01-1.42; P =. 040), diabetic microvascular complications (HR: 1.91; 95% CI, 1.30-2.81; P <. 001), chronic kidney disease (HR: 1.81; 95% CI, 1.25-2.64; P =. 002), use of acarbose (HR: 2.24; 95% CI, 1.35-3.74; P =. 002), and use of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (HR: 4.00; 95% CI: 1.28-12.53, P =. 017) were associated with PaC development on multivariable Cox regression adjusting for the duration of DM, mean glycated hemoglobin A1c, and history of pancreatic diseases. Stage 3A CKD or below was associated with PaC but not stage 3B or beyond. Conclusion: Diabetic microvascular complications, especially stage 1, 2, and 3A CKD, were associated with PaCs.  © 2022 The Author(s).

Although T2D is reported as the adverse factor for predicting PC prognosis, its pathophysiology and relation with PC remain unknown. This study focused on exploring differentially expressed genes (DEGs) as well as their functional roles in T2D and PC, aiming to reveal the underlying association between the T2D and PC. To identify DEGs in T2D and PC, this study analyzed four microarray datasets obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Then, this work carried out enrichment as well as protein–protein interaction (PPI) network analysis for exploring DEGs-enriched functions and pathway. Besides, expression of hub genes was explored. TISIDB database was adopted to analyze the correlations among key gene and immune characteristics. Finally, the key gene expression was confirmed in vitro. DEGs were first screened from gene expression profiles of T2D and PC datasets, respectively. Then 135 common genes were identified in these four datasets. Based on functional analysis, common DEGs were mostly related to hormone secretion and metabolism pathways. Four hub genes were up-regulated, among which, MAFB was the most significant potential biomarker for PC. MAFB expression was strongly correlated with chemokines, chemokine receptors and immunomodulators. Finally, RT-qPCR was conducted to demonstrate the MAFB expression in T2D and PC. This study identified 15 hub genes with significant effects on the association of T2D with PC, and MAFB gene might be a biomarker for PC and had potential treatment value for PC. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Bioinformatics;

These associations may be secondary to consequences of peripheral insulin resistance, pancreatic β-cell dysfunction, or hyperglycemia itself. Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) is a measure of hyperglycemia, whereas plasma insulin and proinsulin are markers of peripheral insulin resistance, and the proinsulin to insulin ratio marks pancreatic β-cell dysfunction. Methods This was a prospective, nested case-control study of 449 case patients and 982 control subjects with prediagnostic blood samples and no diabetes history from five prospective US cohorts followed through 2008. Two or three control subjects were matched to each case patient by year of birth, cohort, smoking, and fasting status. Pancreatic cancer risk was assessed by prediagnostic HbA1c, insulin, proinsulin, and proinsulin to insulin ratio with multivariable-adjusted logistic regression. All P values were two-sided. Results The highest vs lowest quintiles of HbA1c, insulin, and proinsulin were associated with with an increased risk for pancreatic cancer (odds ratio [OR] = 1.79; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.17 to 2.72, Ptrend =. 04 for HbA1c; OR = 1.57; 95% CI = 1.08 to 2.30; Ptrend =. 002 for insulin; and OR = 2.22; 95% CI = 1.50 to 3.29; Ptrend <. 001 for proinsulin). Proinsulin to insulin ratio was not associated with pancreatic cancer risk. Results were similar across studies (all Pheterogeneity >. 29). In cancers developing 10 or more years after blood collection, the associations with insulin and proinsulin became stronger (highest vs lowest quintile, OR = 2.77; 95% CI = 1.28 to 5.99 for insulin and OR = 3.60; 95% CI = 1.68 to 7.72 for proinsulin). In mutually adjusted models including HbA1c, insulin, and proinsulin, only proinsulin remained statistically significant (highest vs lowest quintile, OR = 2.55; 95% CI = 1.54 to 4.21; Ptrend <. 001). Conclusions Among participants from five large prospective cohorts, circulating markers of peripheral insulin resistance, rather than hyperglycemia or pancreatic β-cell dysfunction, were independently associated with pancreatic cancer risk. © The Author 2013.","","Adenocarcinoma; Adult; Aged; Biological Markers; Blood Glucose; Case-Control Studies; Female; Hemoglobin A, Glycosylated; Humans; Hyperglycemia; Insulin; Insulin Resistance; Insulin-Secreting Cells; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Odds Ratio; Pancreatic Neoplasms; Proinsulin; Prospective Studies; hemoglobin A1c; insulin; proinsulin; adult; article; blood sampling; cancer risk; controlled study; diet restriction; female; glucose intolerance; human; hyperglycemia; insulin resistance; major clinical study; male; pancreas cancer; pancreas islet beta cell; priority journal; smoking","","hemoglobin A1c, 62572-11-6; insulin, 9004-10-8; proinsulin, 11062-00-3, 9035-68-1; Biological Markers, ; Blood Glucose, ; Hemoglobin A, Glycosylated, ; Insulin, ; Proinsulin, 9035-68-1; hemoglobin A1c protein, human, ","","","Promises for Purple; National Institutes of Health, NIH, (CA34944, CA40360, CA97193, HL26490, HL34595, P01 CA55075, P01 CA87969, R01 CA124908); Howard Hughes Medical Institute, HHMI; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, HHS, (24152, 32100–2, 32105–6, 32108–9, 32111–13, 32115, 32118–32119, 32122, 42107–26, 42129–32, 44221, CA047988, HL043851, HL080467, N01WH22110); National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, NHLBI; National Cancer Institute, NCI, (K07 CA140790, P50CA127003); Lustgarten Foundation; American Society of Clinical Oncology, ASCO","The NHS and HPFS are supported by the National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health (NIH) (grant numbers P01 CA87969, P01 CA55075, P50 CA127003, R01 CA124908).

However, its influence on pancreatic cancer was controversial. Therefore, we did a meta-analysis of currently available observational studies on the issue. Methods: We did a PubMed and ISI Web of Science search for observational articles. The pooled relative risk (RR) was estimated using a random-effect model. Heterogeneity was evaluated using I2 statistic. Subgroup analysis was performed to explore the source of heterogeneity and confirm the overall estimates. Publication bias was also examined. Results: The analysis included 11 articles (13 studies) comprising 10 cohort studies and 3 case-control studies. Use of metformin was associated with a significant lower risk of pancreatic cancer [RR 0.63, 95% confidence internal (CI) 0.46-0.86, p=. 0.003]. In a total 11 subgroup analyses, 5 provided the consistent result with pooled effect estimates of overall analysis. No publication bias was detected by Begg's (. Z=. -0.79, p=. 0.428) and Egger's test (. t=. -0.92, p=. 0.378). Conclusions: From present observational studies, use of metformin appears to be associated with a reduced risk of pancreatic cancer in patients with T2DM. Further investigation is needed. © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","Diabetes mellitus; Meta-analysis; Metformin; Pancreatic cancer","Case-Control Studies; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Metformin; Pancreatic Neoplasms; Prognosis; Risk Assessment; insulin; metformin; sulfonylurea derivative; antidiabetic agent; metformin; human; meta analysis; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; observational study; pancreas cancer; Review; risk reduction; systematic review; case control study; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Pancreatic Neoplasms; prognosis; risk assessment","","insulin, 9004-10-8; metformin, 1115-70-4, 657-24-9; Hypoglycemic Agents, ; Metformin, ","","","","","Siegel R., Naishadham D., Jemal A., Cancer statistics, 2012, CA: Cancer J Clin, 62, pp. 10-29, (2012); Andriulli A., Festa V., Botteri E., Valvano M.R., Koch M., Bassi C., Et al., Neoadjuvant/preoperative gemcitabine for patients with localized pancreatic cancer: a meta-analysis of prospective studies, Ann Surg Oncol, 19, pp. 1644-1662, (2012); Davis J.L., Pandalai P.K., Ripley R.T., Langan R.C., Avital I., Expanding surgical treatment of pancreatic cancer: the role of regional chemotherapy, Pancreas, 41, pp. 678-684, (2012); Nentwich M.F., Bockhorn M., Konig A., Izbicki J.R., Cataldegirmen G., Surgery for advanced and metastatic pancreatic cancer-current state and trends, Anticancer Res, 32, pp. 1999-2002, (2012); McAuliffe J.C., Christein J.D., Type 2 diabetes mellitus and pancreatic cancer, Surg Clin N Am, 93, pp. 619-627, (2013); Pannala R., Basu A., Petersen G.M., Chari S.T., New-onset diabetes: a potential clue to the early diagnosis of pancreatic cancer, Lancet Oncol, 10, pp. 88-95, (2009); Bartosch-Harlid A., Andersson R., Diabetes mellitus in pancreatic cancer and the need for diagnosis of asymptomatic disease, Pancreatol: Off J Int Assoc Pancreatol, 10, pp. 423-428, (2010); Bailey C.J., Turner R.C., Metformin, N Engl J Med, 334, pp. 574-579, (1996); Ben Sahra I., Le Marchand-Brustel Y., Tanti J.F., Bost F., Metformin in cancer therapy: a new perspective for an old antidiabetic drug?, Mol Cancer Ther, 9, pp. 1092-1099, (2010); Pollak M., Metformin and pancreatic cancer: a clue requiring investigation, Clin Cancer Res: Off J Am Assoc Cancer Res, 18, pp. 2723-2725, (2012); Bao B., Wang Z., Ali S., Ahmad A., Azmi A.S., Sarkar S.H., Et al., Metformin inhibits cell proliferation, migration and invasion by attenuating CSC function mediated by deregulating miRNAs in pancreatic cancer cells, Cancer Prev Res, 5, pp. 355-364, (2012); Hirsch H.A., Iliopoulos D., Tsichlis P.N., Struhl K., Metformin selectively targets cancer stem cells, and acts together with chemotherapy to block tumor growth and prolong remission, Cancer Res, 69, pp. 7507-7511, (2009); Bednar F., Simeone D.M., Metformin and cancer stem cells: old drug, new targets, Cancer Prev Res, 5, pp. 351-354, (2012); Kisfalvi K., Moro A., Sinnett-Smith J., Eibl G., Rozengurt E., Metformin inhibits the growth of human pancreatic cancer xenografts, Pancreas, 42, pp. 781-785, (2013); Decensi A., Puntoni M., Goodwin P., Cazzaniga M., Gennari A., Bonanni B., Et al., Metformin and cancer risk in diabetic patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis, Cancer Prev Res, 3, pp. 1451-1461, (2010); Noto H., Goto A., Tsujimoto T., Noda M., Cancer risk in diabetic patients treated with metformin: a systematic review and meta-analysis, PloS ONE, 7, (2012); Guyatt G.H., Oxman A.D., Vist G., Kunz R., Brozek J., Alonso-Coello P., Et al., GRADE guidelines: 4.

We examined the possible metformin effect on total, esophageal, gastric, colorectal (CRC), hepatocellular (HCC) and pancreatic cancers in a Taiwanese cohort.Methods: A representative sample of 800,000 was drawn from the Taiwanese National Health Insurance data of 2000. A cohort of 480,984 participants 20 years or older, diabetes-cancer-free on 1st January 2000 was formed and categorized as four groups by DM and metformin usage status. Eligible incident cancer events had to occur one year after the index date until the end of 2007. The Cox proportional-hazards model evaluated relative risk of cancer for treated DM patients with or without metformin. The covariates included age, gender, other oral anti-hyperglycemic medication, Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) score and metformin exposure dosage and duration.Results: With diabetes but no anti-hyperglycemic medication, cancer incidence density increased at least 2-fold for total, CRC and HCC. On metformin, total, CRC and HCC incidences decreased to near non-diabetic levels but to varying degrees depending on gender and cancer type (CRC in women, liver in men). Adjustment for other oral anti-hyperglycemic agents usage and CCI made the benefit of metformin more evident [hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals): total 0.12 (0.08-0.19), CRC 0.36 (0.13-0.98), liver 0.06 (0.02-0.16), pancreas 0.15 (0.03-0.79)]. There was a significant gender interaction with metformin in CRC which favored women. Metformin dosage for a significant decrease in cancer incidence was ≤500 mg/day.Conclusions: Metformin can reduce the incidences of several gastroenterological cancers in treated diabetes. © 2011 Lee et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","","Adult; Aged; Colorectal Neoplasms; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Female; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Incidence; Liver Neoplasms; Male; Metformin; Middle Aged; Pancreatic Neoplasms; Proportional Hazards Models; Prospective Studies; Registries; Sex Factors; Taiwan; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult; hyperglycemic agent; metformin; antidiabetic agent; metformin; adult; age; aged; article; cancer incidence; cohort analysis; colorectal cancer; comorbidity; esophagus cancer; female; gender; human; individuality; liver cell carcinoma; major clinical study; male; national health insurance; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; pancreas cancer; population research; prospective study; randomized controlled trial; risk reduction; stomach cancer; Taiwan; treatment duration; colorectal tumor; incidence; liver tumor; middle aged; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; pancreas tumor; proportional hazards model; register; sex difference; statistics; Taiwan; treatment outcome","","metformin, 1115-70-4, 657-24-9; Hypoglycemic Agents, ; Metformin, 657-24-9","","","National Health Research Institutes, NHRI","This study was sponsored by the National Health Research Institutes.

Since its first description, several new trials (including three cardiovascular outcome trials) have been published, substantially increasing the available data set. This suggests the need for an update of the previous meta-analysis. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A Medline search for GLP-1 receptor agonists (exenatide, liraglutide, lixisenatide, albiglutide, dulaglutide, or semaglutide) was performed, collecting all randomized clinical trials, with duration ≥52 weeks, enrolling patients with type 2 diabetes, and comparing a GLP-1 receptor agonist with placebo or any other non-GLP-1 receptor agonist drug. The endpoints were pancreatitis, pancreatic cancer reported as serious adverse events. Mantel-Haenszel Odds Ratio (MH-OR) with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) was calculated for all outcomes defined above, on an intention-to-treat basis. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: A total of 43 trials fulfilling inclusion criteria (all reporting data on pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer) was identified. GLP-1 RA showed no association with pancreatitis (MH-OR 1.24 [0.94, 1.64]; P=0.13) and pancreatic cancer (MH-OR 1.28 [0.87, 1.89]; P=0.20). CONCLUSIONS: No clear evidence of risk for pancreatitis was observed, whereas data on pancreatic cancer are too scarce to draw any conclusion. © 2020 EDIZIONI MINERVA MEDICA.","Diabetes mellitus; Meta-analysis;

Up to 85% of PDAC patients are diagnosed with diabetes or hyperglycaemia at the time of cancer diagnosis. It indicates that impaired glucose homeostasis is a common event in PDAC. However, the mechanism of association between PDAC and diabetes is very complex and still not fully understood. The most important factor in the development of PDAC based on diabetes, is the long-term persistence of high intra-pancreatic insulin concentrations. A lowering of blood glucose levels is essential in type 2 diabetes mellitus management for the prevention and delayed progression of chronic complications. Currently, various classes of antidiabetic drugs are used in therapy. The influence of insulin treatment on the risk of PDAC is assessed as unclear. A recent analysis showed that this risk is higher in patients with new-onset diabetes. Insulin analogues were reported to be associated with PDAC, but recent trials did not confirm a significantly higher cancer risk. Metformin, recommended as the first-choice therapy in type 2 diabetes, possesses anti-cancer activity and can prolong the survival of PDAC patients. In can be used in monotherapy or with other antidiabetic drugs, such as SGLT-2 inhibitors, incretins, sulphonylureas, or thiazolidinediones. SGLT-2 inhibitors may be protective in PDAC by inhibiting tumour growth. Incretin-based therapy appears to have a beneficial effect in PDAC patients even after long-term therapy. Sulphonylureas and alpha-guanidine inhibitors are associated with a significantly lower risk of pancreatic cancer. But only one study reported an association between therapy with pioglitazone and an increased risk of PDAC. It is possible that specific types of antidiabetic drugs may have different impacts on pancreatic cancer development. Moreover, the intriguing question of whether diabetes can facilitate PDAC development remains unanswered. This review presents the results of recent studies on the effect of anti-diabetic treatment on pancreatic cancer development and potential mechanisms associated with the activity of these drugs. © 2021 Via Medica.

We examined whether other factors that characterize the insulin resistance syndrome are also risk factors for pancreatic cancer in a prospective cohort study of 631,172 men and women (ages 45+ years) who received health insurance from the Korean Medical Insurance Corporation. The biennial medical evaluations from 1992 to 1995 provided the baseline information for this study. Relative risks (RR) were estimated using proportional hazards models adjusted for age, sex, smoking, and fasting serum glucose (after excluding the first 2 years of follow-up). There were 2,194 incident cases of pancreatic cancer diagnosed in the cohort over a median follow-up of 12 years. There was no evidence that pancreatic cancer risk was associated with total cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, WBC count, or body mass index. Abnormal levels of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase were both associated with a moderately increased risk of developing the disease (40+ versus <20; RR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.14-1.55; Ptrend = 0.05 and RR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.16-1.56; Ptrend = 0.02, respectively). Excluding 6 years of follow-up reduced this RR (95% CI) for aspartate aminotransferase to 1.22 (1.01-1.49), but even after excluding 10 years follow-up the RR (95% CI) for alanine aminotransferase was unchanged [1.36 (1.01-1.83)]. Although fasting serum glucose has been found previously to be associated with pancreatic cancer risk in this cohort, most other factors that characterize insulin resistance syndrome were not associated with pancreatic cancer risk. The association with elevated liver enzyme levels is a novel finding that warrants further investigation.

About 80% of the patients with pancreatic cancer have glucose metabolism alterations. This suggests an association between type 2 DM and pancreatic cancer risk and progression. There are hypotheses that show metabolic links between the diseases, due to insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, low grade chronic inflammation, and alteration in the insulin-insulin-like growth factor axis. The use of diabetes medications can influence the extent of carcinogenesis of the pancreas. This study briefly reviews recent literature on investigation of metabolic link of type 2 DM, risk of carcinogenesis of the pancreas and their association, as well as the current understanding of metabolic pathways implicated in metabolism and cellular growth. The main finding of this review, although there are discrepancies, is that according to most research long-term DM does not raise the risk of pancreatic cancer. The longest duration of DM may reflect hypoinsulinemia due to treatment for hyperglycemia, but recent onset diabetes was associated with increased risk for pancreatic cancer due to hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia. In conclusion, the review demonstrates that type 2 DM and the duration of diabetes pose a risk for pancreatic carcinogenesis, and that there is biological link between the diseases.

Concentration data of 58 metabolites enabled discrimination of pancreatic cancer (PC) patients from healthy controls (HC) and long-term type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients. A panel of eight metabolites was proposed and successfully tested for group discrimination. Furthermore, a prediction model for the identification of at-risk individuals for future development of pancreatic cancer was built and tested on recent-onset diabetes mellitus (RODM) patients. Six of 59 RODM samples were assessed as PC with an accuracy of more than 80%. The health condition of these individuals was re-examined, and in four cases, a correlation to the prediction was found.
